Nu am văzut nicio cale posibilă pentru pace și reconciliere, nici bunii mei prieteni Willow [diplomat albion și expert politolog] și Krasnov [diplomat Vostokian]. Mi s-a părut mai degrabă o cheltuială pentru ca Elam să-și arate noua importanță pe continent și sunt destul de sigur că asta a și fost. Un banchet cu confetti și șampanie în cinstea păcii și a camaraderiei, fără ca pacea sau camaraderia să fie vreundeva.",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_3": "Kargia nu voia să cumpere cereale ci să dețină mijloacele de producție agricolă, așteptându-se ca Somertin să predea întreaga regiune Panere care, și mai rău, era separată de ei de Iber și Vythm'k. Somertin dorea ca Kargia să desființeze așa pur și simplu armata sa angorjată și să se întoarcă înapoi la felul în care erau lucrurile (deja insuportabile pentru Kargia), astfel încât în viitor să fie lipsite de resurse și de putere iar Somertin i-ar putea înghiți cu totul. Elam voia Shqiperia, fără a avea ceva demn de dat în schimb sau suficientă putere să fie luat în serios de Somertin. Transkal nu a participat deoarece nu se aștepta să fie un combatant atât de curând, se așteptau să intre în război în 1848, nu în 1845. Într-un fel, doar Polazia a obținut ceea ce își dorea. A putut să pretindă în continuare că era neutră și nepartizană, dar pentru ceilalți nu a existat absolut nicio metodă pragmatică de a obține o reconciliere",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_4": "Am putea fi tentați să spunem că Kargiții ar fi câștigat războiul, dacă Coaliția Glorioasă nu ar fi implicat Reginatul [Transkal] în război. Să nu ne pripim, atât Chromit cât și Marele Lord știau că Vanessa nu și-a făcut simpatiile pro-Somertin secrete nimănui. Și erau mai multe pârghii pe care Chromit să le tragă pentru a-i aduce în război decât ca [Steward General] Shmelev să-i țină afară. Nu era o chestiune de 'dacă' ci de 'când'. Operațiunea ambițioasă a Kargiei de o a asasina pe Majestatea Sa a fost o recunoaștere cinică a situației și o încercare disperată de a face Transkal cât mai inutilizabil pentru interesele Somertin. Să nu credem că Transkal a salvat Kaula de vârful de lance kargit. Privind retrospectiv, forțele locale au fost suficiente pentru a-i alunga, deși transkaliții au ajutat cu siguranță să o facă mai repede",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_5": "Oare somertinii credeau că Polazia va rămâne neutră? În ciuda discursului pasional al lui Kronegar, unii încă credeau. John Doe cu toată fațada lui exuberantă și imbecilă știa cum stau lucrurile. Numai printr-un atac surpriză planificat în total secret și executat în tăcere radio completă aveau vreo șansă să securizeze o aterizare pe continent. Și au avut noroc, au găsit Armada de Safir nepregătită și au făcut-o țăndări, în timp ce au forțat două din celelalte trei [armade] să se retragă în confuzia generală și incertitudinea Înaltului Comandament Naval Somertin cu privire la viitorul curs de acțiune. Vor încerca să taie proviziile forței polaziene prin atacuri submarine sau îi vor lăsa să le invadeze țara cu nerușinare? Desigur, au ales prima opțiune iar polazienii i-au reprezentat în propaganda lor ca brute care scufundă vase civile, fără a menționa faptul că au pus intenționat muniții de război în navele civile menționate pentru a-i provoca.",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_6": "Pentru Elam Acordul de la Balbec a fost ca banchetul de absolvire pentru o domnișoară, șansa de a arăta lumii rochia, machiajul, manichiura și coafura ei aranjate cu migală. Și au reușit, au reconstruit un mic oraș de oază într-o atracție diplomatică pe care toate puterile ar respecta-o. Fotografiile au arătat mobilier luxos și mâncăruri felurite, un sultan zâmbitor toastând pentru pace și camaraderie și participanți activi dezbătând energic. A fost prima victorie de imagine a Elamului de secole și, într-adevăr, își arătase cea mai bună față lumii. Reprezentanții puterilor globale nu au ezitat deloc în a lăuda eforturile lor și în a spera că vor deveni în curând un membru stimabil al 'comunității' internaționale. Această frumoasă fațadă fiind în opoziție puternică cu actele abominabile pe care le-au comis mai târziu.",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_7": "Deși Somertin a convocat o 'Cruciadă împotriva Kargitismului', ei nu prea se așteptau ca mulți să-și lase viața în urmă și să se urce pe o navă spre nicăieri. Dar războiul a durat mult, infrastructura lor era capabilă să-i acomodeze pe mulți iar simpatie pentru ei exista în multe locuri... foarte multe locuri. De-a lungul războiului lung de șapte ani trebuie să fi fost mai mult de o sută de mii de voluntari organizați în diverse stindarde. Cei mai mulți veneau din Vulturia, Statele Unite ale Iețirei, Schwartzenwald și Spaghettone, unii din Maharlika, Chaco, alte țări Iețirane și chiar o mână de veterani din Polazia care au servit cu mult timp în urmă sub generalul Breg. Problema a fost înclinația generalisimului Dumitrescu de a-i trimite în bătălii periculoase, văzându-i drept 'carne de tun gratis', din fericire Chromit și Anders i-au descurajat această atitudine nesăbuită",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_8": "Kargia nu era singură, în ciuda faptului că era în război pentru obiectivele și preocupările naționale proprii ea încă s-a clătinat între naționalism și internaționalism. La fel cum Kargia avea 'ambiții anticoloniale' asupra Astartiei, Imperiul Fusang avea 'ambiții antiimperiale' peste Asiya și așa s-au găsit tovarăși de pat. Totuși, deși Fusang era o națiune cu o populație mare, avea mult mai puține resurse și era mult mai puțin industrializată decât Kargia. O mie de baterii de artilerie antiaeriană ar fi fost un fleac pentru Kargia, dar pentru Fusang era un mare efort. Cu toate astea au încercat pe cât posibil să-i ajute cu arme, voluntari și echipamente, enervându-i iremediabil pe somertini",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_9": "Atât Regina, cât și generalii ei nu au considerat niciodată voluntarii sau ajutorul străin ca o variabilă în calculele lor. Într-adevăr, Fusang avea... alte simpatii, Imperiul Dragon simula neutralitate când de fapt încercau de fapt să salveze fața în fața impotenței lor, Puterile coloniale nu au putut nici măcar să numească Transkal pe hartă, iar Poarta a fost prietenoasă cu Elam, dușmanul lor. Cu toate acestea au existat niște aventurieri, aproximativ o sută (nici măcar nu sunt suficienti pentru a aduna un batalion) care au mers să lupte în steagul lui Gustav. Nu a murit niciunul dintre acești voluntari, fiind staționați în Polazia în unități de garnizoană",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_10": "Polazia părea să fi atras paiul scurt când a venit vorba de ajutor străin și voluntari. Vulturia a anunțat 'neutralitate' în conflictul dintre polazieni și somertini, o neutralitate care trădează în mare măsură afinitățile pro-Somertin datorită abilității diplomatice fantastice a lui Chromit. Schwartzenwald, Spaghettone și Vostok au denunțat Polazia ca agresor ipocrit și au interzis categoric formarea de unități voluntare. Numai Galia și Albion păreau să audă situația lor, dar fără o cale sigură de a transporta voluntari sau echipamente prin blocada somertină și o circumstanță politică dificilă (Parlamentul refuzând de-a dreptul să mai cheltuiască un ban pe fundul insolvabil al polazienilor).<br>Au rămas singuri",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_11": "Când sultanul Ngannangan (succesorul lui Sunanak pe care l-a ucis Polasie) din Trakabuli a trimis o baterie de obuziere în Elam pentru război, a existat multă bucurie, multă propagandă că islamicii din întreaga lume au fost alături de ei. Desigur, asta a fost mai mult în spirit decât în material. Marea majoritate dintre ei fie nu aveau decât voluntari sau puști de trimis, în număr mic, fie rareori reușeau să cumpere lucruri de la puterile coloniale industrializate și să le dăruiască tânărului sultan. Asemenea sultanul Murad a cumpărat o sută de sedanuri din Vulturia, sultanul Chodong a cumpărat și a trimis o baterie de artilerie precum a făcut Ngannangan iar sultanul Gozen din Sunda a făcut și el la fel. Ca scară, era o donație de o sută de sedanuri blindate aduse cu mare dificultate în timp ce marile puteri ale continentului foloseau nu mii, ci zeci de mii de camioane și alte vehicule non-blindate. Ca să nu mai vorbim de artilerie câteva sute de piese de artilerie în timp ce Kargia și Somertin aveau tehnic câte 100.000 fiecare.",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_12": "Degenerații ipocriți de la nord nu ne vor învinge; nici păgânii barbari de la sud, nici măcar sataniştii psihopați ai Gosudarstvului! Hoardele lor blestemate poate că au călcat hotarele patriei noastre sfinte; dar nici nu știu ce-au trezit.<br> Le vom rupe armele, le vom spulbera mașinile de război și le vom îneca hoardele blestemate sub un val de oțel! Suntem uniți, necuceriți și de necucerit. Dreptatea pentru spurcăciunile lor va veni prompt, severă și inevitabilă!",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_13": "Timpul să intrăm în bârlogul lui Fafnir și să-i luăm comorile este acum. Grâne, metale, aur, toate ne pot aparține dacă cutezăm să punem mâinile pe ele. Cu cât amânăm, cu atât mai mare și mai primejdioasă se face Dihania Albă. Fără fapte hotărâte, cutezătoare vom rămâne o notă de subsol în istorie; fereastra noastră să acționăm se strâmtează pe zi ce trece. Tovarăși, vremea să acționăm, să luăm în coarne Dihania este ACUM! Să mergem uniți împotriva-i; gloria ne așteaptă peste Munții Stâncoși!",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_14": "Azi plătim prețul prostiei, indolenței și indiferenței lorzilor ce au fost. Suntem în război pe două fronturi, înapoiați și dependenți de aliații noștri pentru echipamente de bază. Trebuie să punem țara la cale și trebuie să o facem repede. Pot lorzii să țipe, pot să bocească, să-mi dea cu piciorul în față dacă așa poftesc dar voi trage Transkalul în epoca modernă cu forța dacă asta va fi nevoie",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_15": "Bineînțeles că oamenii nu vor război. Vor cadouri, învoiri de la plata dărilor la stat, ajutoare sociale, triumfuri, drepturi și promisiuni, și-i vor vota pe cei a căror responsabilitate și voință e să le ofere. Dar alea trebuie să vină de undeva iar metodele bune, curate, nu sunt mereu suficiente. Și de aici încolo avem război",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_16": "Pornim la Jihad! Împotriva kaffirilor de la nord care stau aroganți în fața noastră; care țin piciorul pe Shqiperia noastră; care cresc zi de zi și se uită la noi cu ochi negri. Mergem să-i ucidem și să răzbunăm umilința de la Sassafras. Shallahu Akbar!",

				"Dumitrescu","Directives have arrived; You are to hold the river line and delay the enemy advance as much as possible.",
				"Vladov","With what forces!? I have barely a corps and they're in terrible shape! I cannot possibly hope to hold the river line without armor!",
				"Dumitrescu","I know but we have no choice. Make do until we mobilize and then you'll get reinforcements. Every minute you buy is crucial. ",
				"Vladov","Did you tell them we have the most vulnerable section of the front?",
				"Dumitrescu","Is it? The central front looks as bad. There's more kargits there.",
				"Vladov","The central front is a mountain range, Dumitrescu. Mountains. This is a river whose bridgeheads we lost. We're understrength and outnumbered, Dumitrescu!",
				"Dumitrescu","Alright, alright, I get it.",
				"Vladov","We're fighting over plains, for fuck's sake! Tell them to move their ass! If you don't, they'll break through and fuck everyone's rear, Dumitrescu!",
				"Dumitrescu","I understand. Vladov, I'll send the first shares towards your section. You buy us some time and I've got your back. How's that?",
				"Vladov","Good. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll have to move my command post back. Send armor soon!",
				"Dumitrescu","I will, just hold the line.",
				"Vladov","Wait, don't hang up.",
				"Dumitrescu","What is it?",
				"Vladov","Just remembered, Happy birtday, Generalissimo. I realize you're buried in paperwork and as stressed as we here are, so I hope at least something nice will happen for you soon, hopefully today.",
				"Dumitrescu","Thank you lad. You know what I say, right? We just gotta roll with what life throws at us. ",
				"Vladov","Ain't that the truth"

				[//Chapter 1, Mission 2

					"Dumitrescu","Anders, your command of the Center West Front has been confirmed. You are ordered to hold the mountain passes to the last man",
					"Anders","What are you talking about? The attack took most of them before we could even get there.",
					"Dumitrescu"," Oh crap! How many held?",
					"Anders","Two are in our hands, the other fifteen are lost.",
					"Dumitrescu","All is not lost. Hold them for as long as possible.", 
					"Anders","I'll do as much as I can, but there better be reinforcements available.",
					"Dumitrescu","Mobilization is taking place as we speak. You'll have the men you want, but you need to hold.",
					"Anders","What if Vladov's south collapses?",
					"Dumitrescu","Then you are to take command and strenghten the Mudakevo-Patna-Konna-Harpa line. But I doubt Vladov's forces will collapse; he's a competent commander.",
					"Anders","God be with us. May I proceed with my duties?",
					"Dumitrescu","Please do"

					],
				[//Chapter 1, Mission 3

					"Dumitrescu","Allo, allo! Stoyan, are you there?",
					"Stoyan","On duty, sir.",
					"Dumitrescu","What's the status in the north? The polasians, how far did they get?",
					"Stoyan","We're holding them off behind the Heva river. We have a bridgehead over Heva, however.",
					"Dumitrescu","Fantastic! How did you manage to hold them off so well?",
					"Stoyan","Simply because they're morons! They march without scouting, attack without probing, and they seldom secure their flanks.",
					"Dumitrescu","My reports say they have numeric advantage. Is that true?",
					"Stoyan","Yes, yes it is.",
					"Dumitrescu","Beware, they will wise up over time. I need you to keep them out of Moh and the surrounding oilfields.",
					"Stoyan","Will do.",

				[//Chapter 1, Mission 4
					"Dumitrescu", "Central to Vladov, are you there?",
					"Vladov","Yeah, what is it?",
					"Dumitrescu", "I want a status update from you.",
					"Vladov","We're hanging by a thread; we've been pushed back 500Km and now we're about 50Km in front of Patna. Morale is low and we need-",
					"Dumitrescu","Reinforcements, I know. We're sending more your way, don't worry.",
					"Vladov","Good, good. And what are HC's plans?",
					"Dumitrescu", "The arms plants are outproducing the Kargit ones. The longer we hold on, the more they'll be depleted and we refreshed. ",
					"Vladov", "Good, how long until we have more armor than them?",
					"Dumitrescu","A year or so",
					"Vladov", "That's not good; within a year they'll push us beyond the capital.",
					"Dumitrescu","Bullshit; intel says their supply lines are overstretched.",
					"Vladov","Is that so? It better be, I'm eager to counterattack as soon as possible.",
					"Dumitrescu","Good luck holding Patna before that, wait, wasn't your sister living there? How is she?",
					"Vladov","She'll be fine, thank God. Told her to move her ass to Kaula, can't take risks when it comes to family.", 
					"Dumitrescu","Well I suppose you have one more reason to hold that city. Good luck!",
					"Vladov","To you too, and send me more armor!",
					"Dumitrescu","Oh you and your armor. If you keep Patna I'll send you a battalion of Imperterritus tanks. How's that?",
					"Vladov","Don't you worry one second, I'll keep you up on those words.",
					],
				[//Chapter 1, Mission 5
					"Chromit","Generalissimo, what is the operational status?",
					"Dumitrescu","Kargit pace of advance is slowing down; they are close to their Clausewitz Culmination. That, however, must not obscure the fact that the bulk of their forces has mustered ahead of Kaula",
					"Chromit","They will try to envelop it as they did with Patna?",
					"Dumitrescu","The river flanks are well defended this time, which explains why they rather seem poised to reach the citadel. They believe it'll be faster than storming fortified bridgeheads",
					"Chromit","Fools. They underestimate us, even now",
					"Dumitrescu","I hear fortification and preparation efforts are going well",
					"Chromit","We had expanded the Civil Guard with tons of refugees who are willing to work for bread; and with women and children who would otherwise have no utility",
					"Dumitrescu","Good; but I'll rather have you raise new units from them. We need filler for the frontlines and fast",
					"Chromit","You will have them. Any boy 14 or older is getting incorporated. We've raised ten entire divisions in such manner.",
					"Dumitrescu","One worry off my chest.",
					"Chromit","After the battle of Kaula is over, however, we WILL disband these ad-hoc banners. Snot-nosed children with rudimentary training lose efficiency very quickly",
					"Dumitrescu","So long as Kaula holds. Now, are we prepared against paradrops? Kargits seem to do them every time",
					"Chromit","Women, elders and boys 10-14 will be sent to the batteries. The paratroopers will be torn down, and those who DO manage to land will be hunted down and gutted.",
					"Dumitrescu","With what reserves? All troops are needed to the frontlines",
					"Chromit","Why, with the Honour Guard and the Transkalites",
					"Dumitrescu","They arrived? And we're also raising the honour guard?",
					"Chromit","Why, didn't you notice the white noise? Where do you think it's coming from?",
					"Vanessa","Primarch, Generalissimo, inform me what is the Honour Guard if you will.",
					"Dumitrescu","Ah, Your Majesty. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.",
					"Chromit","The Honour Guard is the sacred duty of the Somertin ruling class. In times of extraordinary duress, politicians will leave instructions to be carried out in their absence, and then they draft themselves into a temporary Guard battalion.",
					"Vanessa","You're joking with me",
					"Chromit","Not the case. It is a temporary measure and our instructions contain provisions for any contingency imaginable.",
					"Vanessa","Apologies if it came out the wrong way. I can understand that it can function in some manner; but politicians going to the frontline? That's a fairytale",
					"Chromit","It is our culture. Somertins do not have jobs, we have a duty and we do it with fanatic dedication.",
					"Vanessa","Transkal has a saying that 'there are as many customs as there are yurts'. I see now what that means. Have you, however, considered what would happen to Somertin shall the Honour Guard perish or incur severe casualties?",
					"Chromit","Yes. For such situation we have prepared contingency measures and discussed them with the Military High Command.",
					"Chromit","The sum of these measures is called Operation ARMAGEDDON",
					"Vanessa","I don't like the way it sounds. What does it involve?",
					"Chromit","It shall be revealed to you after the Battle of Kaula. For now I have said all that I needed to. Excuse me but I have to go prepare for the ordeal.",
					"Vanessa","You're...I see. Farewell and may your God be with you all.",
					"Dumitrescu","There are affairs that the Generalissimo of Somertin and the monarch of its ally must discuss. Your men have arrived in Kaula, have they not?",
					"Vanessa","Indeed, we are sending an entire army group in the citadel numbering two hundred thousand with heavy equipment",
					"Vanessa","And Bertha rail-artillery.",
					"Dumitrescu","Perhaps Chromit wants to fight house-for-house and drive them out of the capital but I find that foolish. With all the authority I command, I ask you to divert half or more of your men to the south outskirts of the city.",
					"Vanessa","I'll have to speak with the generals to do so",
					"Dumitrescu","And which one of them is the best for corps command?",
					"Vanessa","General Vilho",
					"Dumitrescu","I want him and your best men on this maneuver",
					"Vanessa","Normally you would be asking for a fantasy, since Transkalite generals do not command whichever troops they'd like but the men that follow them. Luckily for you Vilho's men are the best",
					"Dumitrescu","Very good. Together with Anders's men they will smash into the kargit flanks like a pincer. I'll set up my headquarters inside the citadel and hold the line until then",
					"Vanessa","You and the Primarch are holding up very well given how much is on the line.",
					"Dumitrescu","Is it surprising? Being alone against an unforgiving enemy, with destiny and everything on the line, where one mistake can cost a hundred thousand lives puts a lot of stress on one's nerves. But it also fills him with resolution; there is no duty more sacred than defeating the Kargits and saving the nation. I am sure you can understand",
					"Vanessa","I can't get rid of the feeling that I am blundering somewhere, though",
					"Dumitrescu","Only the right person wonders if they might not be suited. The fool is all too confident. Now, mobilize yourself. You need to convey my directives to your generals so that we may drive the kargit scum out of our holy motherland.",
					"Vanessa","Impolite way to speak to someone who technically outranks you. Is it the vaunted somertin arrogance I've been warned of by some advisors?",
					"Dumitrescu","Young girl, I do not care who you are and what pleasantries are customary in your land. I have a war to carry out, not politics. If you want honeyed words, talk to Chromit.",
					"Vanessa","Rude, but I like not being fed fritters.",
					"Vanessa","As you wish, Generalissimo Dumitrescu."

				[[//Chapter 2, Mission 1
				"Dumitrescu","Allo Hryniuk, you are needed",
				"Hryniuk","Understood. How may I serve?",
				"Dumitrescu","Anders and the transkalite Vilho had led a pincer which saw a hundred thousand kargits encircled. However, they lack the force to liquidate them AND parry kargit attempts to break them out.",
				"Hryniuk","I understand that my duty will be to liquidate that pocket",
				"Dumitrescu","Precisely",
				"Hryniuk","That is an honor. I will gladly take up this ordeal",
				"Dumitrescu","The capital's rail network has been brought up to nominal status, as it should, so when the Kargits capitulate, we will ship them to the agricultural districts out east.",
				"Hryniuk","Stupid question, I know, but how are the camps administered?",
				"Dumitrescu","HEH. That is far from a stupid question. As far as the higher ups told me, they are set up in farmable areas of Burluk and the captives will recieve good rations AND be able to earn more by farming or working.",
				"Hryniuk","I find it wasteful that we give them such good conditions. They are scum and deserve nothing less than death.",
				"Dumitrescu","However the Paragons may argue, it's not a matter of kindness. It's cold pragmatism. If rumours that prisoner camps are horrible circulate, the enemies will be more inclined to fight to the death, thus making any advance slower and more costly.",
				"Hryniuk","They do not extend the same courtesy to us, you know? God forbid anyone end up in a kargit POW camp. Or worse, an Elamite one",
				"Dumitrescu","I figure the Kargits consider not killing prisoners on the spot kindness. Their pragmatism goes more towards the brutal type. As for the Elamites? I reckon their industrial base being horrendous as it is does not allow such expenses.",
				"Hryniuk","I am not referring to that. But it's best to avoid that subject for now",
				"Dumitrescu","So be it. Now, you understood your task, did you?",
				"Hryniuk","Affirmative",
				"Dumitrescu","Good. Next issue. Vladov's Central Front is in tatters after Kuzmich and Broz's armies have been decimated. From this moment onward you are promoted to Field Marshal and I'm expecting you to rebuild the central front from the ground up",
				"Hryniuk","I have several questions-",
				"Dumitrescu","Your army's command will be given to general Kovalchuk who will be promoted to the rank of Marshal. Argeseanu no longer wants to be the field marshal of the central front due to stress and ulcers, he is afraid it will make them worse. Central Front will be rebuilt with burlukians, omscians and others. Anything else?",
				"Hryniuk","Not really, you read my mind.",
				"Dumitrescu","Make haste, Anders's forces will have to shift northwards to cover the arm of the pincer. We can't allow an empty spot in the pocket.",
				"Hryniuk","At once, sir!",
				"Dumitrescu","Kovalchuk, allo!",
				"Kovalchuk","Allo generalissimo",
				"Dumitrescu","You're promoted to Marshal of the 3rd Army Group. Get your ass to liquidating the kargit pocket right outside Kaula",
				"Kovalchuk","But what happened to Hryniuk?",
				"Dumitrescu","He's promoted as well",
				"Dumitrescu","Listen well. I want you to accomplish that mission, but do NOT act as you've done so far. Stop throwing men into the enemy machineguns as if they're expendable! It damages morale like you wouldn't believe",
				"Kovalchuk","But how do you expect me to obtain swift victories if I'm to be slow and methodical?",
				"Dumitrescu","Jesus Christ gave us artillery, tanks and airpower. Use them instead of human waves.",
				"Kovalchuk","Wait what?",
				"Dumitrescu","It's an interriveran expression. Now good luck with it and get to work because I'm up to my neck in shit. Martinovic, allo! Are you there?",
				"Martinovic","Yeah, yeah, what is it?",
				"Dumitrescu","(if he's drunk again I swear to God I'm going to shove a fire poker up his ass) The time has come for you to lead a counteroffensive. Get Argeseanu to coordinate with you and push ahead. Ideally I want you to get as far away in Blachia and kick them out of Molda, over the bridges.",
				"Martinovic","Sigh... my poor Stulpika will still buckle under the kargit boot.",
				"Dumitrescu","Think about it rationally. We cannot liberate Stulpikar without being able to stage an offensive from Dacia, and we cannot liberate Dacia without Blachia. Do what I tell you and you'll deliver your people",
				"Martinovic","Stulpikan boys shall have to die for interriveran soil... sigh",
				"Dumitrescu","AND WHAT'S THE FUCKING PROBLEM WITH IT!? Do you think you can liberate that region with only your men and your arms? Interriveran boys will die for your fucking home so show some respect! And let's not get into how our arms are made in Bukale, in Molda.",
				"Martinovic","Okay, okay, you don't have to shout",
				"Dumitrescu","(I swear to God stulpikans have a bone in their brain. He and Puric, that fucking idiot) Get to work, drive the kargits out of Interriverana and you'll see Stulpikar happy and free. Fail and I'll break your whiny bitch neck with my own two hands.",
				"Martinovic","Aye aye, captain...",
				"Dumitrescu","Argeseanu! Answer, you old fartbag!",
				"Argeseanu","I'm here",
				"Dumitrescu","Operation Harpoon will liberate Blachia, yadda yadda. Support Martinovic's westward advance. It's against Bela, you cannot fail.",

				"Dumitrescu","Good news",
				"Laszlo","Do I get materiel to bash the Elamites or what?",
				"Dumitrescu","You read my lips. From now on should have obtained a clear superiority in both men and materiel. And you will go on the offensive, to liberate Carpathia and Trnagora",
				"Laszlo","I advise Ali's sector. He's the single most incompetent pasha, and horribly overstretched.",
				"Dumitrescu","That is right. You and Shmelev will cooperate to excute a fancy operation. While the east flank(that of Shmelev) pushes deep and drives a wedge between Ali and Piezzola, the right hook drives towards the Kandahar Elbow. That is of utmost importance",
				"Laszlo","What about the center?",
				"Dumitrescu","The center should just try to take ground and reach the Sassafras",
				"Laszlo","Not good enough. We must do a pincer maneuver and encircle whatever Elamites we can.",
				"Dumitrescu","That is unpracticable. We cannot be as optimistic as to hope to cross multiple bridges and do a pincer at the same time",
				"Laszlo","Normally no, Generalissimo. But we are dealing with Ali here",
				"Dumitrescu","Alright alright. If it's possible, do it. If not, it is what it is.",
				"Laszlo","Good. Now dial up Shmelev so we can tell him.",
				"Dumitrescu","Allo allo! General Shmelev, this is Generalissimo Dumitrescu",
				"Shmelev","Allo to you too. How is your day?",
				"Dumitrescu","Good enough. We call to ask your aid in an operation.",
				"Shmelev","No can do. I only take orders from the Queen.",
				"Dumitrescu","The Queen has agreed to extensive cooperation between the Somertin forces and the Transkalites. She would approve nigh anything.",
				"Shmelev","I recognize the Queen is taking a suspiciously cooperative stance with the Whites. However I do not share her enthusiasm of selling our customs and traditions for incorporation into an amorphous blob. You want me to do something, you tell the Queen to tell me.",

				"Laszlo","Is he for serious?",
				"Dumitrescu","Yep. As stubborn as a mule.",
				"Laszlo","Possibly the worst allies.",
				"Dumitrescu","I beg to differ. Had Polasians been our allies, we'd have been staggered by their incompetence, Elamites would have been more prickly, and Kargits would have never been our allies under any circumstance.",
				"Laszlo","Still. Some of these Transkalites have a bone in their brain.",
				"Dumitrescu","They say that unlike your parents, you can choose your friends. In our case we can choose neither. On the bright side, half their generals are decent.",
				"Laszlo","Why is neither on the south front then?",
				"Dumitrescu","They sent the good ones to the west, against the Kargits. And the bad ones to the south against the Elamites.",
				"Laszlo","Wait, was I sent here because High Command thinks me incompetent?",
				"Dumitrescu","Absolutely not. You were given the south because it's highly mobile; and you are known to be neurotic and aggressive. High Command believes that, given sufficient men and materiel, you can make swift work of the Elamites.",
				"Laszlo","Good. Because that's what I intend to go do right now",

				"Anders","Done. Intel status?",
				"Dragalina","Kargit forces have lost initiative on the central front, they sent reinforcements which are now behind the lines of the central front. More reserves stand even further back. They expect us to attempt a pincer maneuver towards Patna, likely.",
				"Anders","What have the probing attacks achieved?",
				"Dumitrescu","Revealed weak points in their frontline, mostly where the salient was cut. A few on other sectors, as well.",
				"Anders","I expect those weakspots have already been filled. Would make sense, since their offensive has slacked for the last two weeks",
				"Dumitrescu","I second that. Kargit High Command may be arrogant, but they are no fools. They absolutely do not want to have to explain another pocket. Dragalina, have recon planes noticed anything other than reinforcements behind the lines?",
				"Dragalina","Aye. Scouting sorties confirmed that the Kargits are attempting to build a line of fortifications almost two hundred kilometers beyond the general frontline. From the lake, north through the plains and up to Golubuju. These 'fortifications' however look unimpressive.",
				"Anders","How exactly?",
				"Dragalina","A line of barbed wire, palisades and a concrete bunker every 2 kilometers.",
				"Anders","That's not bad, considering the circumstances.",
				"Dumitrescu","Fortifications to prepare against a general offensive, and reserves to blunt a pincer. It will be hard to advance like this.",

				"Anders","Because, as the original plan stipulated, we are engaging into a broad-front offensive without the possibility of the enemy army collapsing, hope they use the reserves to plug that front, and then following it up with a pincer on the Patna sector. So many of them will never see their home",
				"Dumitrescu","Tell them that the objective is to capture a line of kargit-made forts before it's finished. They may be motivated because once they have the forts, the enemy will hardly attack right then. Now, I want the armor redirected",

				"Dumitrescu","Figure of speech. Don't send the Imperterrituses to the main offensive, send them to the Patna sector, to only be deployed after the Asekaras made and broadened a breakthrough already",
				"Anders","Even still, it risks them casting ALL of the reserves, they'll be certain we're going for Patna",
				"Dumitrescu","I disagree. The Gorlitzes are on the rest of the front and those are more of a breakthrough tank than the Imperterritus.",
				"Anders","There will be an armored concentration in Patna sector. Period.",
				"Dumitrescu","Then precede it with a Guard assault! And with the air force concentrated everywhere except Patna. They will not know whether it's a general offensive or a pincer maneuver. And in the daze of the general offensive, they will be uncertain what to reinforce and where.",

				"Anders","Fortunately, the reserves are diminished, and we have our own. Imperterritus-type tanks have been transported over special rails and will join in the breakthrough.",
				"Dumitrescu","Be very careful. Our guard rosters are diminished and the Imperterritus is NOT a breakthrough tank.",
				"Anders","I believe it will achieve some manner breach on the mere fact that it is intimidating, escorted by Guards and that the Kargits have very few arms capable of even denting it.",
				"Dumitrescu","Many men died for this opportunity, and more Guards sacrificed themselves than we can afford to throw at a regular push. You NEED to make this maneuver work.",

				"Khuzov","Except for the breadth of the west bank. Once you take the west bank, we'll fly in descent shock troops in the middle of the east bank. That'll force them to push their reserves intowards the citadel. Then, we unleash The Maneuver, the mother of all envelopment assaults. ",
				"Hans","Same as with Patna? Respectfully sir, I reserve the right to skepticism",
				"Khuzov","Do you think there is another alternative?",
				"Hans","Liehman Doctrine. We got intel of where their nerve agent stockpiles are, so we can bomb those, and then gas the fuckers without them being able to retaliate.",
				"Khuzov","Son, settle down. We only know where like 10% of them are. If we try that we'd unleash a catastrophe of proportions",
				"Hans","What do you mean 10%? We found whereabouts to metric tons of sarin, mustard gas and phosgene.",
				"Khuzov","Yeah, and intel to corroborate that their real stockpile is ten times that.",
				"Hans","Well then we don't have much wiggle room. We have to go forward with this offensive because it's the only option.",
				"Khuzov","A good option however. Seeing how much land they lost, the subhumans are likely to be desperate for a victory in Kaula. That'd stave off their capitulation desires, and we must counteract that",
				"Hans","Who will lead the paratroopers?",
				"Khuzov","Starinov. We trust his leadership, hell, you know his exploits.",
				"Hans","Agreed, Starinov is a capable general. One more question: Can you ensure proper materiel flow to my sector?",
				"Khuzov","Absolutely, son. On your shoulder stands the fate of our world revolution. You will have all that you need. You will rejoice to know that 800 Koschei Tanks will be sent to your front only this month. Asekaras? Many more.",

				"Hoth","But how did that come to be in the first place? The Polasians are incompetent but what forces did Somertin have to demolish them with?",
				"Khuzov","Right... that. Remember how they had Stoyan's army and a guard chapter on the Heva? According to intel those were shifted to Meglev, and Kovalchuk's army group took that section instead",
				"Schorner","So are the subhumans less moronic than we thought or are the Polasians even more pathetic than them?",
				"Hans","How about both? Animals have tremendous strength when cornered, and Somertin is a mammoth of a nation. But Polasie has been rotting for decades already.",
				"Hans","Simmering in effeteness and degeneracy. They had fallen so far from their stature merely a century ago.",
				"Shwartzkopf","It's all about the navy. Somertin had amassed a fleet larger than that of Kargia and Polasie put together, but Polasie still had like 75% of their number of capital ships at the beginning of the war.",
				"Shwartzkopf","And I don't know how the fuck but the white animals conjured cutting-edge FCS and catapults. They had surpassed Polasie in technology AND numbers.",
				"Shwartzkopf","They slept on their laurels, that Polasie has the best-trained ship crews, but it was proven to them that they weren't so great after all",
				"Shwartzkopf","With the navy sank and their army diminutive, they were knelt. Hell, within the next few months they'll probably take the rest of Polasie. It doesn't look like Polasie can reverse this course of action",
				"Weber","I say it's alright. One army that we don't have to bother destroying, and they have to station it there; to do anti-partisan operations and so on. Somertin will collapse no matter what happens with Polasie",
				"Khuzov","And Elam",
				"Hoth","What do you mean Elam?",
				"Khuzov","The whites pushed them back fifty kilometers. Not a lot but it shows the Elamite frailty",
				"Hans","They overextended in the first place. We told them 'try to capture Iaș or at least give us a perimeter'. But they advance towards Burluk and Omck of all places. Do they not realize it's impossible to take with their lack of arms?",
				"Weber","It'll be difficult to take even for us. The Omck Exclave is covered by mountains and taiga on all sides; and they'll likely bomb all railways in the meanwhile.",
				"Schorner","It's like when you disinfect a bacteria; it retreats into its endospore and you need more force to destroy that one. Omck is the endospore of the White Plague",
				"Khuzov","The Great Lord told us not to worry about Omck, we will take it after everything else. Their front has gaps doesn't it?",
				"Hans","Yes, I have seen some areas without armor. The rail-lines are sparser here but we can still do some pincer maneuvers to destroy contingents of Anders's front.",
				"Schorner","Perfect for an offensive",
				"Khuzov","Indeed. Bakraka, West Meglev and Sopvon must fall; and thus deny them even more recruitment potential; as well as industry, yadda yadda. I'll have Kulik's 4th Army take Sopvon, but the lot of you must charge through West Meglev and towards Omck",

				"Khuzov","SIIIGGGGHHHHHH",
				"Bela","Look on the bright side, they diverted men to parry Kulik's 4th Army and Hans's 3rd to the north",
				"Kulik","And since Kaula and Meglev fell, we have achieved numeric parity while we STILL have operational initiative. We can go at it at our normal pace, and we will win either way.",

				"Khuzov","But I am disappointed with the rate at which this front has been moving.",
				"Khuzov","I'll send over twenty airwings towards your sectors. Use them and your own to gain air superiority and batter the fortifications",
				"Bela","The whites cannot reinforce their depleted airwings after Sopvon and Bakraka fallen, so I believe we can do this easily",

Kargits fight for glory, Polasians and Elamites for money, Somertins for their fucking life. What does the average Transkalite soldier fight for? For their commander to get the right vagina.

Sail anywhere else and you will see less of a disaster than what we have!",

				"Shmelev","The Whites have been bled thoroughly. They cannot cross the Rockies and end the Kargits. It will be a back-and-forth for generations. And then what's the point of fusing with them?",
				"Shmelev","The Queen is delusional. We have a better shot by aligning with the Glorious Coallition and carving Somertin 4-ways",
				"Gustav","That will not happen Shmelev. If Kargia were to kneel Somertin they would be in the position of taking the most of it. Elam moves sluggishly, Polasie moved sluggishly, and Transkal is such a joke that they'd only stationed 100.000 men to stave us off",

				"Shmelev","Take. But not hold.",

				"Shmelev","Alright boy, you've seen what you have lost. Unless you and me fix this country you won't get to marry any queen",
				"Shmelev","We must depose the traitourous Vanessa and instate her little sister",
				"Krystof","And what guarantees that you won't marry her instead?",
				"Shmelev","The northerners were right about something. This country needs a little centralizing. So if you join me, you can have the Queen's hand. But she has at least half a decade until she'll be fit to rule",
				"Shmelev","I'll be the regent in that case. Does that sound like a deal to you?",
				"Krystof","Deal",

				"Mutasarif","Beggars can't be choosers. Send them to Ali's front and divert some men from Shqiperia to assist them. We need EVERYTHING that we can muster",
				"Ali","Good, good. Let us hold them off and make sure they don't get to Sekir Bashka, otherwise they will cut off the entire Shqiperia Front. Which is probably what they will try to do.",
				"Mutasarif","The fate of the Caliphate depends on this battle. Let us do our best.",
				"Esfahani","Your Majesty, it would be best for Elam if you flew and met Chromit of Somertin for a discussion between four eyes. His head is much cooler than Laszlo's. Seek armistice with him",
				"Mutasarif","Dumitrescu will also do, although I don't think we have a way of reaching him, he's likely on the west front.",
				"Hashrazzat","Awwww, I get all nervous when I gotta talk to important people face to face. Can't I call him instead?",
				"Ali","Will you seek comfort in the arms of your 'loli waifus' again then?",

Already fifty thousand women have charged our men with hatchets or knives, seeking death')",

Far back into their history they even cannibalized a president for raising taxes.

				"Esfahani","Praise be to Shallah, we held the passes. They seem to be entrenching and they're not getting as many reinforcements as before",
				"Mutasarif","Very good, very good. What was this force?",
				"Esfahani","57th Corps of the Somertin Eigth Army",
				"Mutasarif","FIFTY-SEVEN!? We surrounded and destroyed that corpus before!",
				"Esfahani","Most of it, but they seem to have remade it",
				"Mutasarif","Why are you so calm Ibrahim!? They remade an entire corpus from the ground up!",
				"Esfahani","I am... not calm. Just exhausted. Haven't slept in 40 hours, had to manage things at the front personally.",
				"Mutasarif","I understand. The sultan and us pashas were going to discuss industrial mobilization but you can go take a nap. You deserve it",
				"Esfahani","No, no, count me in. I can sleep after this.",
				"Hassan","We need more military production centers. As fast as we can get them up",
				"Esfahani","Machinery for them takes the longest to produce. Blast furnaces and lattices are expensive and need laborious work.",
				"Hassan","Precisely why we need to use... alternative methods. ",
				"Mutasarif","What do you have in mind? Do keep in mind we are overspending and importing is out of the question",
				"Hassan","One of my engineers said he can use naval machinery and wharfs to improvise arms plants. I have absolutely no idea how, but I trust him. That man is a genius. What I want then is the approval to strip down all naval bases except for the one in the Holy City and turn them to arms plants.",
				"Mutasarif","Fantastic! We don't need any more of them anyways. I'll get the Sultan to approve that for you. Thank you for the idea, brother.",
				"Hassan","The least I could do. Since, you know, there is no chance of us building more capital warships anytime soon.",
				"Esfahani","Forgive me for the stupid question but Somertin and Transkal are allied, and Somertin has a terrifying navy. Won't they base it in some Norgellian port and strike at us?",
				"Hassan","Transkalite ports are rudimentary, their wharfs cannot manage ships above 10.000 tons. Anything Somertin could send here would be outclassed by our Yavuz Selim and Osman Evvel. And they need all of them in the north where the Kargit and Polasian navies combined have some sort of temporary parity with theirs",
				"Hassan","HOWEVER! The shipyards in Cymelium are trying to put to sea three battlecruisers that could cause us great headaches",
				"Esfahani","Why aren't we striking them while they're not operational?",
				"Hassan","Nobody ever made a shipyard in a place where enemy fleets can just come and destroy them on a whim. Except by the use of aircraft carriers, of course, but we	don't have such a thing.",
				"Hassan","As for Cymelium, it's in the Asok Gulf that's chock full of coastal artillery. If our fleet entered that gulf, it would be surrounded on almost all sides by 40cm cannons. The outcome of that wouldn't be pretty",
				"Mutasarif","Clearly any such idea flies out the window then. We can't do a port strike of our own",
				"Esfahani","On another note, I have become aware that there are 'craftsmen' in Ararat and Ortadolu. These men make rifles and bullets without industrial machinery",
				"Mutasarif","Come again?",
				"Esfahani","I am not joking, they use these clay furnaces and hammers to forge rifles by hand, and copper they melt in stone crucibles to pour in bullet molds. As their forefathers were doing before the Industrial Age",
				"Hassan","That sounds romantic, such devotion to the craft of their ancestors. We can set offices to find them and order as many as they can make",
				"Esfahani","Exactly. We can rely on them to cover a part of our rifle needs, and shift part of the actual rifle factories to anti-tank rifle production. Shallah have mercy, the Whites are sending more and more tanks and we need to be prepared.",
				"Mutasarif","I'll get this approved as well, it is a great idea.",
				"Ali","Are the factories running 24/24?",
				"Hassan","Obviously. On 2 12-hour shifts because there's not many of them; they're easy to staff. Specialists are lacking, but we put them on 14 hour shifts so they manage.",
				"Ali","What about the arms plants of the occupied regions? We can ask the Jizya to be paid in rifles instead of money for the factory workers",
				"Mutasarif","We are already doing that, Ali",
				"Ali","We are? Good, good",
				"Mutasarif","This seems to be all we can get for now. Thank you all for your contributions. And you, Ibrahim, go get some sleep.",
				"Esfahani","zzz",
				"Mutasarif","Uhh... alright",

				"Hassan","I have saved the boys and much of the armament. Though the fleet took a bit of a beating",
				"Hassan","Makes me wonder though... where was the Transkalite navy?",
				"Mutasarif","My best bet would be... they're getting repairs? Or upgrades? I do not know how navy works.",
				"Hassan","It sure does look that way. Captured one lieutenant; and he blabbed that Transkal has purchased a few FCS computators from Somertin. Though why would one install FCS on 20-years-old-obsolete-cruisers beats me.",
				"Esfahani","Please explain what an FCS is, we do not understand naval jargon.",
				"Hassan","Fire Control System. It's an electromechanical device that coordinates the aiming and reloading of a ship's rigging so that it fires faster and more accurately. All modern ships have FCS of some form or another.",
				"Esfahani","I understand. Do the Yavuz Selim and Osman Evvel have FCS?",
				"Hassan","Yes, I paid for them myself before the war. Had the two battlecruisers sail to Polasie and have it installed. Won't tell you how much it costed, but I absolutely wanted our navy to be modernized and retrofitted.",
				"Mutasarif","You gave away your own money for Elam? You have my utmost respect",
				"Esfahani","Mine as well. Perhaps it is for your sacrifices that Elam has gotten such victories in Transkal.",

				"Narrator","Fortunately, they had incurred heavy losses as well and had to withdraw. And the Ka'aba was as good as protected by Shallah. Not even one shell had touched close to it.",
				"Narrator","Pasha Hassan had been pretty hit by this; he spent one day lamenting his defeat and mourning the great losses.",

				"Ali","It's been three days since they've stopped advancing. What is it? They've run out of oil?",
				"Mutasarif","As a matter of fact, yes. They're too far away from their supply nodes and the oil is running out. Also they've built a lot of railways to get supplies to the point where they began the offensive from, but not as many from there to here.",
				"Ali","We managed to hold Sekir Bashka, huh. Only cost us 300Km",
				"Ali","Damn, I don't feel like joking about it. Leaves a bitter taste in my mouth",
				"Esfahani","Mashallah. Let's hope that the young Sultan has success and that the Kargits can aid us with more equipment.",

		"Anders","Arise, iberians. Barbarians are at the gates!",
		"Anders","Are you all aware of what they did to the Albinians? Those millions they butchered and chased out of their own nation for not abandoning the true faith and not bowing to kargitist insanity?",
		"Ruben","That which he speaks, iberians, is what I lived trough. They had done this to us, they will do it to you as well. To you and the vythmiks, and the panerians, the stulpikans and many more",
		"Anders","Only you can prevent this; will you let them do to you what they want or will you stand up and fight?",
		"Anders","Worry not for arms, we will equip you. Worry not for food, we will feed you. Rise up and stand tall against the barbarians, now or never!",
		"Dumitrescu","How did it go?",
		"Ruben","Tens of thousands have taken rifles, and Anders assigned them to my command.",
		"Dumitrescu","Good. These militias will buy us time to reinforce",
		"Ruben","Militias they may be, but they are iberians. Familiar with the Petric mountains and eating boar, many akin to transkalite riflemen in skill.",
		"Anders","Had we enough time to make it a Military District, the kargits would have been facing a million snipers from the mountains",
		"Dumitrescu","We will make do with what we have."],

		//Hevan militias assembling
		["Stoyan","HC, I have managed to raise three brigades of hevan militias. It wasn't easy, I can tell you that",
		"Dumitrescu","That's to be expected. Poor Broz did his best to raise an army for Heva, only to get it encircled and destroyed by the kargits in the opening phase of the war",
		"Stoyan","I know. That's what? Five percent of the entire male population, gone just like that. The entire region felt it, they're still mourning their boys. Add insult to injury, now the polasians are invading. And we come to tell these people to take up arms again",
		"Dumitrescu","At least it's the polasians, and time is on our side. Eventually we'll assemble the bakrakans, the meglevites, the thraks and even the golubujans. Until then you have to hold the line",
		"Stoyan","Understood. And I'll shuffle my troops, maybe I can get more hevan boys home",
		"Dumitrescu","Pointless sentimentality. Whether you get bakrakans or hevans or anyone else killed, it's still somertin boys. Better you lead them well and attack with energy and determination; it gets the enemy beaten faster and saves more lives overall",
		"Stoyan","I don't think I can imitate the same degree of ferocity as Laszlo, Anders, Hryniuk or others",
		"Dumitrescu","I know. That's why you're on the north front. I just hoped you'd understand something",
		"Dumitrescu","Either way, I have faith in your capabilities. Good luck to you"],

		"Kulik","The cockroaches are padding the line with cheap militias and reinforce-memeing us. It's making it incredibly annoying to liquidate this pocket",
		"Khuzov","See the silver lining to this situation. More 'free-willing workers' for our 'collective revolutionary industrial enterprises'.",
		"Kulik","Alright. Tell Reddit to rate THIS encirclement"],

		//Fall of Vladov

		["Kuzmich","We're merely two hundred kilometers or so from Kaula. Would it be that difficult for them to send some more men here? How many troops does Kaula need anyways!?",
		"Vladov","Chromit and Dumitrescu no doubt want 500.000 in Mazowia, maybe 200.000 more",
		"Kuzmich","Well!? Hryniuk and Kovalchuk are likely in Mazowia already, and they could conscript 200.000 locals since it's a bloody big city!. They should've gotten those numbers by now so where are they?",
		"Kuzmich","Are they going to wait until the pincer is closed and we're trapped like Broz?",
		"Vladov","I'd love to simmer in my own irritation with them but for the sake of not losing our mind in these hard times, let's look on the bright side. The kargits only hold most of the west bank. The pincer has seven kilometers that they want in order to close the pocket, but that's where the reinforcements are coming to strenghten",
		"Kuzmich","The bright side, huh",
		"Vladov","So long as nothing unfortunate happens, we will prevail",
		"Narrator","[15 minutes later, an artillery shell hit the bunker Vladov and Kuzmich were planning in, triggering also an unexploded shell lying by, the resulting explosion cratering the roof of the bunker and incapcitating the two with falling debris]",
		"Narrator","[With them comatose, the subordinate generals fought to the best of their ability and were able to coordinate adequately. But adequate coordination is not enough in front of the kargits]"],

		//Radio silence from Patna

		["Dumitrescu","Vladov! Vladov, did you shove that phone up your ass?",
		"Narrator","[radio silence]",
		"Narrator","By now, the kargits managed to take advantage of the situation and to trap much of Army Group 8 inside Patna"],

		//Raising the Honour Guard
		["Narrator","Somertin's ruling elite, up to the Paradygmist, gathered in a warehouse close to the city center. Dumitrescu attended as the ceremonially-necessary witness and the queen of Transkal came out of curiosity",
		"Dumitrescu","I've had my men bring the guard gear y'all needed. Now let's get this ceremony over with so I hope you won't all recite that pompous ancient oath. This is a warzone, not a parliament.",
		"Chromit","You aren't usually this antsy, Petru",
		"Dumitrescu","Raising a guard banner out of almost all the nation's politicians and sending it into battle is IMMENSELY daunting. One small mistake and our administrative capacity is crippled for years",
		"Chromit","That's why tradition demands us to name successors. We've even had the plebiscites done last month",
		"Dumitrescu","Convenient, but it doesn't completely solve the issue. Let's hope everything goes well",
		"Kovacs","Sword in hand, I saddle for the realm. A paladin of the Lord-",
		"Dumitrescu","Faster please, your Excellency. Four hundred men saying this oath and we'll be here all day.",
		"Kovacs","Very well. Sword in hand I stand tall, so help me God.", 
		"Kovacs","Cardinal Rancane shall be my successor. The war will end and we will triumph, of this I have no doubt. And to rebuild and consolidate thereafter I want a merciful, saintly man and no-one but him suffices.",
		"Borisov","Sword in hand I stand tall, so help me God.",
		"Borisov","For Bakraka's throne I will have my son Paul succeed me if the Lord wants to take me",
		"Michael","Sword in hand I stand tall, so help me God.",
		"Michael","Everyone knows what a horse is, my successor is obviously my cousin.",
		"Chromit","Sword in hand I stand tall, so help me God.",
		"Chromit","Were I to fall, I want the Generalissimo to take the other 9 years of my mandate. The war will be our greatest struggle and none but him would suit this hour",
		"Dumitrescu","I am honoured, but daunted by the responsibility",
		"Dragalina","Rifle in hand I stand tall, so help me providence.",
		"Dragalina","As for the successor... well there's Bogza and Sokolska I had in mind",
		"Chromit","It's Sokolska, isn't it?",
		"Dragalina","Look, Dumitrescu, Chromit. That Bogza is a loose cannon, I know that guy's type, I can handle him to get him to function but Sokolska isn't the kind. She's not ready and probably won't be for a decade or so.",
		"Dragalina","My point is, I leave Sokolska as my successor but I want y'all to liquidate Bogza if I were to kick the bucket. He'd have outlived his usefulness",
		"Dumitrescu","I'll see it handled. With my own two hands if I have to",
		"Chromit","Let's go now. It is our obligation",
		"Narrator","They -and hundreds more- marched on to fight for the eastern bank of Kaula. At the same time the Civil Guard was deployed to go along with them",
		"Vanessa","Say, Emil, do you think Transkal could develop such respectable traditions?",
		"Gustav","Your Majesty, you weigh 50Kg wet and well dressed. Your presence on the battlefield would not be helpful, not to mention your death would be more debilitating to us than Chromit's would be for the whites",
		"Vanessa","I wonder"],
		
		//Spruce's Hook
		["Buvac","Coastal Patrol Airfleet 1,2,3,4 and 5 have been deployed according to your specification",
		"Spruce","And not a moment too soon or too late. I am very much pleased, Commodorissimo.",
		"Buvac","Notify me of whether they coordinated well or anything else. I am awaiting curiously",
		"Kronegar","Did... did we just spawn an air armada of naval bombers right behind enemy lines?",
		"Spruce","We ran into the shallows of the archipelago so that we trigger their desperation into attacking furiously when they think we made a mistake out of overconfidence; then syncronize the carrier-borne planes and land-based ones to strike at the same time from two directions",
		"Orzel","That's kinda like Austerlitz or something like that, I think",
		"Spruce","I like how that sounds. Ursa shall be our Austerlitz",
		"Kronegar","So this is why they put you in charge. You have my respect, cowboy",
		"Spruce","Let's end this",],

		"Vanessa","A ship? Running out of ammo?",
		"Vilho","Absolutely. Osman Evvel and Yavuz Selim are 30.000-ton hulls overgunned with 40-cm artillery. Besides those barbettes being almost too big for them, they also consume a LOT of explosive charges. And shore bombing consumes ammo like you wouldn't believe, ammo Elam does its best to save up. It makes sense they ceased it",
		"Krystof","That's really good news; we can finally go on the offensive and push the greens into the ocean"],
