	"APHORISM_TEXT_2": "What did the Balbec Accords even hope to achieve, realistically? I saw no possible recourse for peace and reconcilliation, neither did my good friends Willow [albion diplomat and expert politologist] and Krasnov[Vostokian diplomat]. It seemed more like an expense for Elam to show off its newfound importance to the continent and I am fairly certain that's what it was. A confetti and champagne banquet in honor of peace and camaraderie, without peace or camaraderie anywhere to be found.",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_3": "Kargia wanted not to buy grain but to own the means of agricultural production, expecting Somertin to hand the entire Panere region which, worse still was separated from them by Iber and Vythm'k. Somertin wanted Kargia to simply disband its burgeoned army and go back to the way things were(already untenable for Kargia) so that in the future they would be so lacking in resources and power that Somertin would swallow them awhole. Elam wanted Shqiperia, without having anything worthwhile to give in exchange or enough power to be taken seriously by Somertin. Transkal didn't participate, as it didn't expect to be a combatant so soon. At the earliest they expected to enter the war in 1848, not 1845. In a way then, only Polasie got what it wanted. It got to pretend that it was neutral and nonpartisan for a while longer. But for the others, there was absolutely no pragmatic method of obtaining reconciliation. War became an inevitable prospect",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_4": "One might be tempted to say that the Kargits would have won the war, had the Glorious Coallition not brought the [Transkal] Commonwealth into it. Let us not fool ourselves, both Chromit and the Great Lord knew, Vanessa did not make her pro-Somertin sympathies a secret to anyone. And there were more levers for Chromit to pull to get her into the war than for [Steward General] Shmelev to pull to keep them out of it. It was not a question of if, but of when and by which manner. Kargia's ambitious operation to assassinate Her Majesty was a cynical acknowledgement of the situation, and a desperate attempt to make Transkal as unusable to Somertin interests as possible. And let us not think that Transkal saved Kaula from the kargit spearhead, in retrospect the local forces were enough to drive them out, though the Transkalites certainly did help do it faster",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_5": "Did Somertins think that Polasie would stay neutral? Despite Kronegar's impassionate speech, some still did. John Doe, for all his boisterous and nonsensical front, knew how things were. That they had but one chance to get a foothold in Somertin, and that was by a surprise attack planned in total secrecy and executed in complete radio silence. And they got lucky, they found the Sapphire Battlefleet and bombed it to smithereens, while forcing two of the other three[battlefleets] to relocate. And they maintained a supply line by virtue of Somertin's naval high command being conflicted as to in what manner they will act. Will they attempt to cut the polasian invasion's supply by submarine attacks or let them invade their nation with impunity. Naturally they chose the first option, and naturally Polasie obtained means to portray them as criminals and brutes who sink civilian vessels in their propaganda, with no mention to the fact that they purposefully put munitions in said merchant vessels so as to provoke them.",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_6": "For Elam the Balbec Accord was just like the graduation banquet to a young lady, the chance for her to show her most beautiful attire and visage to the world. And they managed, they rebuilt a small oasis town into a diplomatic attraction that all powers could respect. Photographies showed luxurious furniture and copious gourmet dishes, a smiling Sultan toasting to peace and camaraderie and active participants debating energetically. It was Elam's first soft power victory in centuries, and indeed it had showed its best face to the world. Representatives from the global powers did not delay one second in praising their efforts and in hoping that they would soon be an esteemed member of the international 'community'. This beautiful facade being in stark opposition to the abominable acts they would commit later.",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_7": "Despite Somertin having called a 'Crusade against Kargitism', they realistically did not expect many to leave their lives behind and get on a ship to buttfucknowhere. But the war was long, their infrastructure capable of handling many, and there was sentiment for them in many places... very many places. Over the course of the seven-year war there must have been more than a hundred thousand volunteers organized in various banners. Most from Eagleland, the United States of Yetsira, Schwartzenwald and Spaghettone, some from Maharlika, Chaco, other Ie»õiran countries and even a handful veterans from Polasie that long ago served under general Breg. The issue was Generalissimo Dumitrescu's penchant for sending them into dangerous battles, seeing them as 'free manpower', fortunately enough Chromit and Anders dissuaded him from this reckless attitude",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_8": "Kargia was not alone, despite mostly being in this for the national goals and concerns it had, it still teetered the edge between nationalism and internationalism. Much like Kargia had 'anticolonial ambitions' on Astartia, the Empire of Fusang had 'antiimperial ambitions' over Asiya. And so they found themselves bedfellows. However though Fusang is a nation with about the same population as Kargia, it has way fewer resources and is way less industrialized. A thousand anti-air artillery bores would be a pittance for Kargia, but for Fusang it was an effort. Still, it did the best it could to send men, rifles and equipment to its ally, and in doing so, angered Somertin irreparably",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_9": "Both the Queen and her generals never once took foreign volunteers or aid as a variable in their calculations. Indeed Fusang had...other sympathies, the Dragon Empire was feigning neutrality when really they were trying to save face in face of their impotence, the colonial powers could not even name Transkal on the map and the Porte was chummy with Elam, their enemy. However, there were some adventurers, a hundred or so(not even enough to assemble a battalion) who went to fight in Gustav's banner for the fun of it. None of those volunteers died as they were stationed in Polasie on garrison duty",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_10": "Polasie appeared to have drawn the short straw when it came to foreign aid and volunteers. Eagleland announced 'neutrality' on the conflict between the polasians and Somertin, a neutrality betraying pro-Somertin affinities in no small measure owing to Chromit's fantastic diplomatic skill. Schwartzenwald, Spaghettone and Vostok denounced Polasie as a hypocritical aggressor and forbid volunteer battalions from forming. Only Gallia and Albion seemed to hear their plight, but with no safe path of transporting volunteers or equipment through Somertin's blockade, and a difficult political circumstance(the Parliament outright refusing to spend even one more penny on the polasians's insolvent ass).<br>They were alone",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_11": "When Sultan Ngannangan(the successor of Sunanak that Polasie murdered) of Trakabuli sent a battery of howitzers to Elam for the war, there was much rejoicing, much propaganda that the ishlamics worldwide stood with them. Of course, that was more in spirit than in material. The vast majority of them either had nothing but volunteers or rifles to send, in small numbers mind you, or rarely they managed to buy things from the industrialized colonial powers and gift them to the young Sultan. Suchlike Sultan Murad bought a hundred Sedans from Eagleland, Sultan Chodong bought and sent a battery of artillery like Ngannangan and Sultan Gozen of Sunda did too. For scale, that was a gift of a hundred armored Sedans brought with great difficulty when the great powers of the continent used not thousands, but tens of thousands of trucks and other non-tank vehicles. To say nothing of artillery, a hundred bores when Kargia and Somertin technically had 100.000 each.",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_12": "The hypocritical degenerates of the north shall not vanquish us; neither the barbaric heathens of the south nor even the psychopathic satanists of the Gosudarstvo! Their cursed hordes may have trodden over our sacred hearth; but by God they know not what they awoken.<br>We will break their arms, shatter their warmachines and drown their cursed hordes under a wave of steel! Now we stand united; unconquered and unconquerable. Justice for their travesties shall be forthcoming, severe and inescapable. We shall prevail!",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_13": "The time to enter Fafnir's den and steal his gold is now. Grain, metals, gold, all can belong to us if we but dare to seize it. The more we delay, the greater the White Monster's threat becomes. Without resolute, determined action we will be consigned to the footnotes of history; and our window to act is growing narrow. The time to act, to skewer the White Monster is NOW, comrades! Let us march forward as one; glory awaits us over the Petric Mountains!",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_14": "Today we pay the price of past stewards stupidity, indolence and indifference. We are at war on two fronts, underdeveloped and dependent on others for basic equipment. We need to set things straight and we need to do it quickly. The stewards may shout, the stewards may sob, the stewards may kick me in the face while at it but I shall drag Transkal into the modern age, kicking and screaming if we must",
	"APHORISM_TEXT_15": "Of course the people do not want war. They want gifts; tax exemptions, handouts, triumphs, liberties or promises, and they vote those whose prerogative is to do as such. But those have to come from somewhere, and good, clean methods can only provide for so long",

	"CODEX_SPECIAL_UNITS_DESC": "Written by General Gustav of Transkal; this booklet explains in detail what exactly determined each nation to develop their iconic infantry units, how they actually work and what is their lay culture",
	"CODEX_SPECIAL_UNITS_TEXT": [
		"<span style='color:white'>Somertin White Guards</span>",
		"Originally called 'The Paladin Corps' and held to the utmost doctrinal standard, although that is being zig-zagged. The standards are lowered or raised based on whether Somertin needs more elite infantry or whether it needs better-quality elite infantry.",
		"As of this war, the balance tilts overwhelmingly towards quantity than quality, such that the minimum requirements consist only of 'The capability of wielding the armament, and the willingness to die for their nation at any given moment.', telling of the impressive capabilities of the White Guards of before. Of note! The White Guard divisions are made of White Guards themselves and of 'Pages' who carry 40Kg of ammunition each, in addition to a Pu»ôka Rifle. The ratio of Guards-to-Pages depends on time period and on battle, men may be taken from regular units to serve as Pages if there is a need for it.",
		"In what regards armament, the White Guards use the 10-Kg PVKA machine guns, which do not have impressive rate of fire, but are capable of tearing through walls and rocks, as well as being extremely reliable. The sufficiency of ammunition is ensured by the Pages, although the Guards themselves carry ammunition themselves. As side-arms, they use the Rapaka Pistol. Some Pages or Guards use Anti-Tank rifles or the (rare) 'TUB' recoil-less anti-tank weapon.",
		"In what regards equipment we can gloss over the Pivot Anti-Recoil Implement, whose only purpose is to reduce recoil and to improve accuracy. The most obvious feature of the Guard is his heavy armor. Which is not a pure-metal armor but a doublet, two centimeters of galvanized titanium alloy on the outside, five centimeters of gambeson on the inside. The outer shell is about as tough as a light tank's chassis, capable of deflecting bullets and shrapnel, while the inner gambeson mitigates damage to the body from the impact-shock of bullets, or artillery that did not hit close enough.",
		"In what regards culture, the Guards are held to extremely high standards of religious faith, physical prowess and willingness to self-sacrifice. They are the epitome of what can be obtained from a soldier, sans usage of drugs or surgical modification.Their lay culture is extremely competitive and proud, they hold disdain for other units and especially for other nations. And their hierarchy is very much influenced by who can carry the most ammunition. Other than that, they have little to no personality other than the morals inoculated by the training. A desired result.Fortunately their behaviour among civilians is exemplary. Perhaps to serve Somertin political image goals or religious doctrine, the Guards are subject to strict codes of conduit inspired from medieval codes of chivalry. Guard units almost never rape, wantonly murder or assault, but they do loot as much as other units, and in Polasian urban areas they tend to cause quite a shitshow of scandal and bickering with the locals.",
		"In what regards usage doctrine, the Guards fulfill an unique niche unavailable to any other nation. They are neither as vulnerable to small arms gunfire as conventional infantry, nor as clumsy as conventional armored units. True infantry tanks, they can buy time for industrial mobilisation and production of real armored units, or can carry out counterattacks against enemy formations that were exhausted. The Guards are difficult to take out and difficult to hold out against, sans posessing heavy armored units.",
		"<br><br><span style='color:black'>Kargit SpecOps</span><br><br>",
		"Going back to around 50 years ago since airplanes were first used in warfare, there have been parachuting troops. Initially the dominance was held by the Somertin Paratroopers with the 'Pantelimon Parachute', but they were surpassed by the greater efficiency of the Kargit 'Golovko Parachute'. The main difference being that by using the Pantelimon, ~15-20% of paratroopers would incur injuries at landing, wheras the Golovko offered no such issues. Moreover, the Somertins had no place for paratroopers in their military doctrine, wheras the Kargits did. And thus, the Kargit Paratroopers are the last serious such force in the world.",
		"They are called SpecOps because their use is Special Operations behind enemy lines, such as infrastructure damaging, bridge holding and such.",
		"In what regards armament, the SpecOps have a weight limit and cannot take more than 10Kg of gear with them, this limits them to a (4.3Kg)Shapka submachinegun and a choice between ammunition, grenades and explosive charges.",	
		"In what regards equipment, the Golovko Parachute stands out. It is made of silk reinforced with plastic material. And with the silk being imported from the Red Dragon Empire, the Kargi make sure to stockpile enough of it before starting any war.",
		"In what regards culture, the SpecOps contrast the rest of the Kargit army. Wheras the bulk of the army is recruited from uneducated, brutish commoners, the SpecOps recieve (militarized)education and special training. Out of the knowledge they will be far behind enemy lines, they are being taught to refrain from angering the local population. They are also taught various notions of geology, survival and bothanics, to ensure their survival.The SpecOp himself is young and cocky but with a real Espirit de Corps, each battalion has their own 'Brotherly Code' and traditions which range from drunken parties, 'Fuck Competitions','Eating Contests' to week-long mountain hiking trips. Trivia: Wheras the average IQ of the Kargit soldier is 95, the average IQ of the SpecOp is 110",
		"In what regards usage doctrine, the SpecOps are the Stiletto of the Kargit operational doctrine. They are always the first stage of an invasion, going behind enemy lines and ruining their supply hubs, rail-networks and radar installations. Their sabotage gives the conventional army a better performance in the shock attack that follows.",	
		"<br><br><span style='color:grey'>Transkalite Snipers</span><br><br>",
		"Uniquely among the nations, the Transkalite Sniper is not a conventional elite unit with special training. It is composed of ethnic battalions raised in the harsh taiga. Their profficiency with the rifle can be solely attributed to them having to hunt for surival from an early age.",
		"In what regards armament, the Snipers do not have any specific weapon. They will use the rifles they were raised with, or what rifles are given to them. They have taken a liking to anti-tank rifles however and use any that is donated by the Somertins with great profficiency.",	
		"In what regards equipment the Snipers have little unique to themselves, only the thick furs and the grey papakha gently swaying to the side.",
		"In what regards culture they are not a monolith, but without doubt the most diverse elite unit of all. Owing to their ethnic groupation, each battalion has their own traditions, faith, dress code and customs. However in general the Snipers are thrifty, resourceful, practical and cool-headed. ",
		"In what regards usage doctrine, they are uniquely completely-defensive units. Their particular skillset works best in terrain they are familiar with, not to mention the abysmal logistical engine of the Transkalite Commonwealth. Until this war, the Snipers never ventured beyond the borders of Transkal.",
		"<br><br><span style='color:blue'>Polasian Marines</span><br><br>",
		"Perhaps the least individually-impressive elite unit, despite being advertised as a well-trained, fierce and brave corps the Polasian Marine is neither particularly brave nor fierce. Perhaps attributable to their doctrinal divergence. Wheras the other elites were designed for fighting peer opponents, the Marines were designed for coastal takeover of minor nations without a proper army or industry. The 'elite' designation serves a practical purpose, to ensure the best men apply to join them.",
		"In what regards armament, the Marines use shotguns, carbines and anti-tank rifles, with grenades and mortars for support, and are expected to have airpower and naval gunfire to their aid.",	
		"In what regards equipment, the Marines are issued engineering gear that can be used to quickly build pontoons or rafts over rivers.",
		"In what regards culture they are the only Polasian unit with Espirit de Corps, and the least cowardly of their nations's forces. With all being young and predominantly provincial, they are less inclined to the ultra-urbanized morals of the Syndicalists, as well as disdaining 'Political Correctness'. Despite common rumours, they do not eat crayons.They ARE, however the best unit at swimming. Rivalling sailors, Marines can swim the entire width of a large river and are expected to, if there is a need for it.",
		"In what regards doctrine of usage, there is a divergence between propaganda and fact. Propaganda goes that they will storm beaches and fight fiercely to take them over, fact has them storming beaches and waiting for fire support to turn the combat in their favour. Sans this firepower, the Marines lose heart and falter. Nevertheless they are the best units on the continent when it comes to storming defended beaches or quickly crossing rivers.",

		"'The best indication of the sorry state the Elamite Army is in, is that units are called Elite simply for being fully-equipped with equipment that is de-jure the mainstay of the army' - quote attributed to Paramount Marshal Khuzov. Indeed, the Stormtroopers are the only fully-equipped units of the Elamite Army, but that should not be reason to underestimate them. They have been assembled from battle-tried battalions(experience from the Akkadian Wars), equipped with good gear and each private shows courage and self-sacrifice that almost matches the White Guards.",	
		"In what regards armament, the Stormtroopers embody Elamite ingenuity. They have more mortars and grenade launchers per platoon than any other army. That must be put into context, Elamite light mortars have the best rate of fire in the world, and Elamite grenade launchers have the best range in the world. The privates that are not issued either GL or LM's will be issued assault rifles.",
		"In what regards equipment, the Stormtroopers are undergoing a transition from heat-resistant white robes to green uniforms(green pigment is the easiest to manufacture) which will perform better in the cool continental climate of Somertin. Aside from that they have no characteristic piece of gear save from the 'Elamite Sack', an implement that carries mortar ammunitions safely and easily.",
		"In what regards culture, we must mention Elamite units are formed around 'Pots'. Each Stormtrooper belongs to a 'Pot' with comrades he considers brothers(often the actual case) and with which must cook and eat together with. Pots are grouped into further formations such as platoons, companies, et cetera.They recieve brief Ishlamic education and are assigned one mini Qu'ran per 'Pot', which they will use to perform regular prayers and observe ritual fasting. They are expected to give their lives for the Sultan and for Shallah, however unlike the White Guards of Somertin, there is no doctrinal enforcement. White Guards will be sacrificed to hold ground and achieve objectives, wheras Stormtroopers can be engaged and disengaged with more levity. The primary reasoning is availability of armaments. Stormtroopers can not be wantonly thrown away, for that would mean the loss of armaments that are expensive and hard to replace.",	
		"In what regards doctrine of usage, the Stormtroopers are the culmination of min-maxing in the context of an insufficiently-industrialized nation and fittingly their model is being imitated world-wide by Maharlikan Juramentados, Chaco Republicans or such. The armament is designed to create a 'Death Zone' between 400 and 500 meters away from the Stormtroopers, and whomever tries to charge at them can be intercepted by a decent volume of gunfire. Perfecting an atypical squad system(Elam uses 5-man squads wheras the others use 9-12 man squads), they are also more versatile than normal units and can cover wider areas with fewer people. The most common method of engagement for Stormtroopers is launching devastating firepower from a distance, and withdrawing before enemies can counterattack them."

		"When it was deemed that the 41-ton Gorlitz was useless, Somertin thought of up-armoring it massively in the hopes that it would advance unimpeded and provide cover for the infantry that was supposed to accompany it. (The Tercio doctrine still dominated at that time, where Somertin High Command believed that land units should be deployed in 3 ranks. One of infantry that would harass the enemy line, one of armor that would repel enemy pushes and one of artillery that would harangue enemy lines from afar.)",
		"Model A had 64 tons and could barely muster 14Km/h of top speed, so only 3 sample models were produced",
		"Model B had 67 tons as a stronger engine was developed and it was up-armored to contain the new engine. 25 models were produced before the Koschei became known and this one's cannon was deemed unsatisfactory",
		"Model C had 71 tons as a result of a naval-grade cannon being installed(an adaptation from the 127mm cannon used by destroyers) but when problems with the suspension became apparent, mass-production was canceled. ",
		"Model D improved the suspension, radios and storage. Mass-production was finally approved and 120 models were assembled in shipyards, as armor factories still did not have the right tooling for it",
		"Model E was a second up-armoring up to 95 tons, but left all factories except locomotive plants unable to build them.",
		"Model F perfectly balanced its armor, suspension and speed and the factories were now capable of mass-production. 250 were built",
		"Model G(at 105 tons) rebalanced the armor layout and redesigned the Imperterritus with modular layout and high-angle sloped armor in mind. It became the golden standard and more than 2000 were produced during the war. No further version was designed because SHC believed superheavy tanks had reached the peak of what they can realistically achieve",
		"Nowadays when one speaks of the Imperterritus it is assumed that they refer to Model G, as it represents over 85% of hulls built. It served as a mobile bunker, providing cover to infantry and arillery and delaying Kargit advance during the Deluge phase. Few to no kargit weapons could pierce it, and bombing it sounds better in theory than in practice.",
		"When the counterattack phase began however, it was briefly used as a brecheur tank to modest results. It being unable to be pierced was an asset, surely, but its inability to dish out firepower in return made it a sluggish boulder whose assaults culminated early and with little ground covered. It was fortunate then that Dumitrescu and Anders had a good deal of creativity. Using motorized artillery and infantry, they managed to amelliorate these faults",

It was the only heavy tank in the world to perfectly balance armor, gunnery and mobility while still being reasonably reliable and easy to produce(due to perfectly-adjusted tooling and lathes, Kargia could produce on average 25% more Koscheis than one would expect)",
		"It mounted a 90cm cannon capable of piercing any other tank(even an Imperterritus, if it was hit from behind, or from the sides within 200m) and with its Putin Engine, it could go as fast as 47-50Km/h top speed, but in combat conditions 15-20Kmh would be more reasonable(still way above any heavy or superheavy tank, and more in line with a medium tank's speed)",
		"Its real unique feature was that each and every tank was issued a radio(as opposed to two per battalion in Elam or one per platoon in Somertin and Polasie) with which they would coordinate attacks in real time and strike at more targets at once.",

		"It's been specially designed to be easy to disassemble and reassemble for a nation where elk and mule transport is the norm. True, the transkalite army prefers it to be railroaded around but in much of Transkal that is an impossibility. So oftentimes it had to be disassembled, carted away by a herd of 1.000 mules then reassembled. The speed with which Transkalite units can do this is nothing short of impressive",
		"Regarding raw stats, it is a 93-ton steel beast that fires 40-cm heavy artillery shells. Such a weapon musters a mediocre amount of firepower due to its long reload time, although operating in Somertin tends to improve that, as ammunition and spare barrels(it has a tendency to shatter its barrel after 100 shots) are much easier to supply with Somertin's developed rail network.",

It turned out to be a good choice, as Elam found itself constantly underarmored and fighting an enemy that had thousand of armored vehicles to spare. Were it not for AMPAC's versatility and efficiency against the hopelessly outmatched Asekara, they would have stood no chance",

It also has a machinegun next to the main gun, for easier suppression of infantry",
		"Due to its design, Elamite army command has deduced that although good on paper, the fixed cannon design would cause it to only work adequately in offensive operations and would lose efficiency when defending. This was no problem for the first part of the war, but that changed when Elam lost the initiative. So as to not be completely overwhelemed, elamite command had to master a particular type of elastic defence. The AMPAC found itself the jewel of elamite warplanning. With the rugged terrain and numerous ambush opportunities Elam managed to hold on a little longer, striking at exposed columns and downhill slopes",

Suicide bombers are only viable when the nation has a surplus of aircraft, no land theater to use them on but is in severe naval inferiority. Elam had a land theater and a shortage of planes; plus the already diminutive South Transkal navy has expended itself.

		"Originally, there were hopes of following the pattern, as to how infantry and armor units have a few that are available to some nations and unavailable to others. Similarly I hoped there would be special ship units available to various nations.",
		"The issue however, was that besides me wanting to preserve a notion of units being grounded in WW2-era technology, most of the nations did not even have a naval tradition. We'll go over what units were planned for whom, and you will understand what I mean",
		"Aircraft Carrier: It wasn't supposed to be a common unit but much like the Imperterritus, the best and costliest unit only available to Somertin. In reality the era of the carrier is knocking and the great industrial powers already have theirs. That included Somertin, Polasie(which converted 4 battlecruisers into carriers as a response to Somertin building 5 carriers from the keel up) and Kargia(which converted one of its battleships into a carrier)",
		"Aviation Battleship: Not to be mistaken with real-life IJN's attempts to make a half-battleship half-carrier hybrid. Reality has proven that doing so results in a monster with a flight deck too short for most planes and with a hull too unbalanced to fire its riggings accurately. In this game it would denote a carrier that has been built by conversion from a battleship. Ironically though battleships are more resilient to conventional strikes than carriers, battleships converted into carriers are actually weaker, for their ammunition mains are more exposed and the electric grid is not fully compatible with what a carrier needs to do. It would have been the Kargit special ship. A cheaper carrier with lower speed and lower HP",
		"Aviation Battlecruiser: Similar to above, it denotes a battlecruiser converted into an aircraft carrier and was supposed to be Polasie-exclusive, given that Polasie is the only colonial power on the continent(but only in Chapter 2 will its colonial holding have any relevance) and thus needed battleships with a longer range of action, thus amassing a fleet of battlecruisers of which it already converted 4 into carriers",
		"Light Carrier: In real life light carriers can be built from the keel-up but in this game they refer specifically to Polasie's late-war conversion of 5(or 6?) light cruisers into smaller aircraft carriers. And it thus would have been a Polasian special unit. A carrier with half the cost, half the HP and half the DPS(since light cruisers have shorter decks and thus cannot accomodate heavy planes or torpedo bombers as a fleet carrier would)",
		" Sol-class/KETER-class Superbattleship: Polasie and Somertin have for decades engaged in a race of building the most stupidly big battleships. Following the launch of SFN Hokma(with 52.500 tons and 41cm guns, it is not considered a superbattleship), Polasie built the 65.000-ton PSS Sol with its 51cm batteries and Somertin answered with the 77.000 ton SFN KETER and its 53cm guns. These last 2, the Sol and the KETER, are far above most battleships in raw power and would serve as Polasie and Somertin-exclusive units, battleships with vastly higher HP and DPS. But the existence of carriers makes them useless and merely a money sink. They were still implemented, but not as a distinct unit. Only as a plot device and with allegations of having been part of Operation THAUMIEL, although that is questionable",
		"Fast Battleship: 10 years before the Great Astartian War, Sultan Faruk put Pasha Hassan in charge of Elam's backwards navy. Hassan's ambition and sacrifices(he had even invested his own salary into the retrofitting operations) saw the ECS Yavuz Selim and ECS Osman Evvel completely facelifted. Their design happened to be scalable so he outfitted them with new rigging, reinforced their armor and installed a new engine. Thus from the obsolete battlecruisers he obtained two modern battleships, and quite a bit faster than the standard battleship of the day. This sent a wave of joy throughout the Ishlamic world as for the first time in 300 years, Faruk's Elam had a relevant(albeit a little lacking in screeners) navy. As such, the Fast Battleship would be Elam-exclusive, with the same price as a battleship but faster by 1-2",
		"Supercruiser: General Vilho's ambition to modernize Jarvi is not addressed, but he has done real efforts. Even going as far as to import two heavy cruiser hulls from Polasie and guns and FCS from Somertin in order to assemble the HMWS Vainamoinen and HMWS Ilmarinen. These two were the size of a heavy cruiser, but with the gunnery of a battleship, and capable of beating any cruiser 1-on-1. Much to Vilho's dismay, the carrier made his creation useless. But for the sake of the game, Transkal would have been able to build cruisers with a slightly higher price but bigger DPS and range",
		"Littoral Cruiser: Two decades ago Polasie has undergone a doctrine shift. Believing that heavy cruisers will no longer play a great role in naval warfare because of battleships and battlecruisers, they had instead converted them towards fulfilling a different role. Polasie's heavy cruisers use light cruiser rigging but much more of it. More guns of lower caliber capable of being used on the coasts to support a naval landing. It turned out that they were right and they had the best cruisers for coastal support. Littoral Cruisers would have been Polasie-exclusive and would trade base DPS for a trait that causes them to deal double damage to land units",
		"Baklava-class Heavy Destroyer: Elam-exclusive, a slightly more expensive destroyer with higher stats",
		"Pilgrim-class Corvette: A cheaper, weaker destroyer exclusive to Somertin and specialized in hunting submarines/aircraft",
		"Submarines","There might be confusion, but I will explain. The game does not have submarines implemented, only Submersibles which are only capable of diving underwater for a limited time. Submarines would be Kargit-exclusive and being capable of diving indefinitely, would have been a high-cost submarine but with higher HP",
		"<br><br>As you see Kargia, Transkal and Elam had one special ship each that were merely variants of standard ships, while Somertin and Polasie had 3 special units each. There's like 20 ideas for ship types, but only 10 slots where they'd actually fit so... yeah. Lot of them had to be truncated."

However it is not, in fact, a stratocratic state not only because the dictator is technically a civilian, but also as the party leaders hold more sway than the generals, and the army has been merged with the paramilitaries in such manner that political loyalty of the army is complete and the loyalty of the generals is kept unquestionable with some...unsavory methods.",

		"Transkal is de jure a matriarchal theocratic monarchy, de facto an oligarchy of autonomous warlords and generals. The power has theoretically been placed the hands of the Queen Goddess by millenium-long religious tradition(Transkal's traditional religions worship a Mother Goddess) combined with peculiar political conditions and circumstances, in practice she has no method of actively enforcing said power and is a figurehead. Sporadic efforts of centralizing the state have all failed, no dynasty managed to keep more than two competent, hands-on queens on the throne and power inevitably came back to the warlords, a typical situation for matriarchies.",
		"The current Queen is said to pursue the dismantlement of the current status quo, but it is unknown how that will happen or what will come after.",

		"Polasie is a liberal democracy, with maximum rights and minimum restrictions bound strictly to humanist principles. A certain thing is allowed if it doesn't hurt someone else. As a result it struggles with abysmal population decline, instability, unmotivated and understaffed military, political factionalism as well as a powerless central government incapable of tackling these issues(despite the Tax Break Party claiming the government to be 'too big'). The strongest institution there is the popular vote and the citizen, where every individual is a citizen",

		"Elam is an islamic caliphate where the Sultan Caliph is the highest, most powerful institution. In theory, at least. Much like Transkal, the current Sultan is not almighty but unlike it, he is more readily obeyed, especially with Pasha Esfahani's extensive support.",

		"And Somertin was left for last since it has BY FAR the most complex system. The Synarchist System(that is, the orthodox version) is defined by its hostility to the notion of a dominant institution. That either people, oligocrats, ideological elite or a single ruler should run the entirety of the state's affairs. As a result it has a complex array of institutions such as the Forum where nine institutions(Men, Women, Clergy, Academia, Craftsmen, Merchants, Army, Navy, Guards-later Air Force) grouped in three classes(laboratores-working class, oratores-intellectual class and bellatores-military class), the Triumvirate(Primarch, Paradygmist and Memeplexus), the Autocephalic Organs(of which the 'Kidney' is the most well known), the Hall of Paragons and the Conclave of Quaesitors. Any more delving into this system's excessively complex nature and how it nevertheless manages to keep the institutions working smoothly without butting heads in this book would be tedious. Enough to say Ladislav Chromit is the Primarch but not the sole ruler. He has been given a Mandate of Wartimes by the previous Paradygmist and maintained by the actual",

		"Phenotypically, the continent has an unexpectedly diverse racial/genetic status. Due to political motivations and interests, analysts diverge on what the 'races' are exactly. The existence of Homo extraneus, subsp. magnus is central; as it populates the majority of Somertin, Kargia and Elam, thus more than 80% of the continent's population has Magnus genes. Worth mentioning is that Kargia considers their own to not be part of the Magnus subspecies but of the Paelazgianus subsubspecies. Somertin geneticists dispute the notion that there would be meaningful racial difference between the two peoples. Transkal, on the other hand, has traces of Magnus genes, but the majority are very distinct, belonging to the Veilum subspecies. And Polasie is becoming more racially mixed but the native population belongs to the Parvus subspecies. All these subspecies are capable of interbreeding between themselves or with other Homo sapiens subspecies<br>Homo extraneus subsp Magnus is remarkable for the great size of its male individuals(1.80m average height and a thickset frame) and extreme sexual dysmorphism, heightened strength but early onset of chronic cardiovascular problems and thus a life expectancy 5-10 years lower than average. In comparision to real life examples it has been described to aesthetically resemble east-europeans; both the males and the females.<br>Homo extraneus subsp Veilum is an average 15-20 shorter than the previous; but no less well built. It also has adaptations to the cold environment he is living in; epicanthic folds for the eyes and balanced fat distribution. The Kal Mountains have caused such a radical difference and separation between it and Magnus<br>Homo extraneus subsp. Parvus is an average 1.65-1.70m in height and of a radically smaller frame compared to Magnus or Veilum; in theory due to having evolved on islands causing them to favour small builds that save energy. Sexual dysmorphism used to be significant in Parvus specimens, but cultural transformations have encouraged the feminisation of males and the masculinisation of females; as a result dysmorphism is artificially diminished to a significant degree.<br>Homo extraneus subsp. Paelazgianus is said by kargit literature to have superior intellect compared to all other races, but evidence is severely lacking.",

		"Religiously, 137M are forcefully ascribed by the gosudarstvo to marcksist atheism(with estimates of 30-50M nevertheless having secret ritual practices based on old kargit faiths or covert christian influences), 3M more are atheist in Polasie, 20M irreligious/not practicing, 2M are 'spiritual but not religious', 6M are Baptist, 5M Presbyterian, Methodist or Quaker, 2M are ishlamis brought from the polasian colonies, 151M Catholic(rumoured to be closer to 170M in reality), 60M Astartian Orthodox(rumoured to be 50-55M in reality; ~40M of which are Ecumenic and ~20M non-Ecumenic), 11M minor forms of Christianity in Somertin, 13M Mosaic, 39M(rumoured to be much fewer after apostolic missions) ascribed to hundreds of native transkalite faiths, 42M Sunn Ishlamis, 15M Shahi Ishlamis and 2M Shqiperian Ishlamis in Elam and Shqiperia",

			"Industry",

		"The Somertin and Kargit states are veritable industrial monsters, both of which are among top three global industrial powerhouses; Somertin (barely) on the first place and Kargia on third place. ",

		"Due to its immense versatility and importance to many industries, it is common practice to measure industrial performance in steel production and we will stay integral to this method.",

		"The numbers are as such: ",

		"Somertin(pre-war) produced an annual 70 million tons of steel, at peak that rose to 140 millions but for most of the war it ran between 110 and 130 millions. They have produced a vast array of infantry equipment, artillery, vehicles, tanks and airplanes, as well as a navy to compete with the colonial powers(the fourth largest navy in the world at that point) including the largest battleship in the entire world. During the war, their industry churned out gargantuan numbers of infantry equipment, medium tanks and artillery, meaningful numbers of heavy and superheavy tanks, of guard gear and even built four aircraft carriers from the keel up.",

		"Pre-war Kargia produced 60 millions, at the peak reached 100 millions and gradually went downhill until Bolwerkstaat Sabrak only managed 3-5% of these numbers. They have produced a vast arsenal of infantry equipment, artillery, vehicles, tanks and airplanes with which they started the war at a lightning pace. Their naval industry was noticeably less competent, disproportionately weaker than their army and air forces",

		"Transkal produced 1 million tons per year before the war and grew to 3 due to the queen's reforms and the machinery they purchased from Somertin. Wheras pre-war they couldn't even produce enough rifles, after the war they had an air force and their own armored division",

		"Polasie on paper produced twenty million tons per year, but de facto most of those were outsourced to Somertin, Kargit and Eagleland comntractors. During the war, they found themselves unable to produce more than 10 million tons, and the civilian sector demanding 90% of them due to them not being able to mobilize the economy at all. The last 10% were mostly used to replenish small arms/artillery lost, and armor/aircraft was on a steady decline until the end of the war.",

		"Finally, Elam produced three million tons per year and a peak 5 millions during the war. With the width of their frontline, these numbers were insufficient to outfit their frontline divisions with enough rifles or artillery, and all armor plants were later repurposed to produce the cheap AMPAC",

		"Gyros, fearing invasion from Elam, prepared itself with enough rifles, artillery and field guns for a defensive war, and with a wing of Akontio torpedo bombers(which they invented) to deter the elamite navy",

			"Economy",

		"Due to the various oddball economic systems on the astartian continent, there is no accurate way to measure their performance, subsequently we will try as much as possible to paraphrase and explain the context",

		"Somertin's economy though somewhat market-compatible cannot be accurately measured due to backing their currency to silver instead of gold, and there existing vast differences in ratio between the two metals between different markets these days. As well, they refuse to trade in the global exchange currency(Albion Pounds), artificially inflate the value of their own currency and apply ludicrous tariffs to all foreign agents that make it unlucrative to export to Somertin. A rough estimate puts their real GDP at 500-1000 billion AP(roughly 2nd or 3rd largest in the world). Their economy is rather advanced for a nation of such a considerable size and population, most economical sectors being present and developed but subject to awkward regulations. Several types of luxury goods are subject to strict limitations or bans, but not anything that one can't be happy without. The nominal GDP is 200 billion AP as declared by Ladislav Chromit and 2-4 times lower the real GDP, allegedly due to the great amount of non-financial entities operating but also with suspicions of Somertin presenting its GDP as lower than it actually is(for unknown reasons)",

		"Nominally they follow the 'Farrkian State Distributism System', a tight and complex mix of orthodox distributism, free-market capitalism and state dirigisme, a functional outgrowth of the failed distributist economy system of before. Additionally, it is the only major global economy without a national stock exchange(Kargia interestingly enough has the Labour Board). The David City Stock Market is only a Vythm'k institution and does not include ventures outside that administrative district",

		"Kargia's economy is even worse, impossible to quantify. Free trade does not exist except in limited black markets and smuggling, the state controls what gets produced and who gets what of it. Other than that it is pretty well developed, the citizens having access to most amenities and goods(albeit after having to wait in considerable queues). Heavy industry is predominant, mostly for the great war planned ahead.",

		"Londinium Stock Exchange was quoted in claiming Kargia to have an economy VERY VERY VERY roughly equivalent to that of a nation in the 200-500 billion AP bracket, but mentioned these numbers 'might as well have been pulled out of their asses'",

		"Transkal's economy is utterly feudal, with a quasi-pyramidal power structure where the upper echelons have access to luxury goods and opulence, while the lower echelons labour rocky soil and have little bar subsistence, worse still an estimate two to five million people live completely outside census, unknown to the government. A market system exists but is rudimentary. Nevertheless the Londinium Stock Exchange estimates Transkal total GDP to be of a measly 40 billion AP",

		"Polasie is a free-market social democracy with high government oversight over the corporations and a vast array of social services including (in a certain region) universal basic income. In theory everyone is happy and has everything they desire, in practice high inflation is a matter of fact(though comfortably blamed on corporations so that popular discontent be kept to a minimum), prices outpace wage growth and due to large wages and environmental overregulation, large sections of production were offshored to foreign powers, some of which simply became hostile/belligerent and cut deliveries, doubling the cost of everything, later hordes of cheap colonial workers were brought in and paradoxically protected by the Welfare Party under the guise of 'humane' free immigration policies. ",
		"The only nation on the continent(and among the few in the world) where the real GDP is lower than the nominal one. The Londinium Stock Exchange places Polasie's real GDP at 127.44 billion AP, with a foreign debt of 138.59 billion AP. It is by far the worst-performing economy on the continent and its bankers are quivering in fear of what may come, especially as the population constantly demands more and more welfare benefits to cope with the quickly rising prices.",

		"Elam's economy is reeling out of feudalism much like Transkal's, but appears to follow Kargia's economic model rather than Somertin or Polasie's. The nation has vast numbers of people living in nomadic, seminomadic or feudal poverty but the urban core shows progress in industrialisation. Elam's industrialisation struggle has been bore by crown corporations where the state is the customer and production coordinator, and civilian goods production as well as common transactions are rather low. The Londinium Stock Exchange believes Elam's real GDP to be approximately 80 billion AP"

		"A father's insanity",

		"Vasily Vasilyev Slobodov was almost a normal kargit man. Almost.",
		"He was born a serf in the times of the Empire, cheered for its collapse and supported the Socialists when they promised land reform. This they delivered...for a month. Almost immediately after giving the peasants land, they demanded it be handed to the state and reorganized in collectives. Those who acquiesced became slaves to a new master, those who refused died. Vasily however, thought himself clever. He told them that he agrees to this collectivisation, but never signed and always delayed any such request with excuses, lies and half-truths.",
		"At first they understood, they let him be. Later they were losing their patience and Vasily ran from home when the comissars(first Besarion's, then the Great Lord's) came, when he failed to hide he took beating after beating. Yet he refused, for ten or maybe twenty years, to give them his land.",
		"Around forty, his wife died of pneumonia and his luck vanished little after. The comissars came and told him something like 'We are taking your children to the forest to pick mushrooms with us. I hope nothing happens to them'. He, finally, relented. Dragged off to Tambov he signed his land away to be given so they'd leave his children in peace; a year later they took those as well; the son for the army and the daughter for the factories",
		"He lived through the war, the somertins did not harm him but stole and killed the cattle he was assigned by the state to care for. What came after shall always baffle me",
		"When(after the war, during Hryniuk's governorship) told by a white guard that the somertin-astartian governance is decollectivizing and all will get a parcel of land alloted to be used free-willingly, he could not believe it. In no more than three days he made his luggage and ran to Tambov to inquire. He left overjoyed with a depeche to consult with the local guards which lands he can take for himself, and they gave him the land that would normally have been his",
		"And when back on that parcel the man lost his mind. Villagers heard him laughing like a maniac, screaming furiously at the clouds and crying loudly, bitterly, in a manner that would unnerve anyone. All at the same time",
		"Now 54, he was avoided by everyone. He had the nasty habits of talking to himself and kicking random fences for no reason; he spoke little and did not answer questions, fortunately he was not aggressive or troublesome; he was the benign kind of a crazy person. One day he just disappeared. Rumour has it he is searching for his children to this day, trying to piece together what life he had",
		"Such a crazy man would have long been forgotten by history, were it not for providence. The same guard who told him of the collectivisation had dreams of being an actor, and he managed to get into Golubuju. He and others made a film about this man who lived through three different eras, bravely opposed the kargit boot for his entire life and then lost his mind with emotion",
		"'A father's insanity' became a masterpiece, and the moment Vasily breaks down in the field became a landmark moment in cinematographic history; depicted with gravitas in all its tragic beauty",
		"|50 years|<br><br>",

		"Aim for the clouds",

		"In the heat of the Transkalite Civil War, Gustav's svelgian army was ordered to advance down the newly modernized Mura Railroad into Jylla. There they met the demoralized men of Krystof's banner and the battle with them was assumed to be brief and simple, due to Svelge having the superiority in armor, artillery and aircraft",
		"But a week passed, two, and the line barely moved. Incredulous, general Gustav drove to the frontline to inspect the situation",
		"There, he found his troops and Krystof's not fighting but biding their time. When in trench they would climb out and play with the enemy; when charging out of the trench more often than not they were aiming at the clouds and going back. The artillery was firing anywhere else, the tanks were not being driven and the planes were not strafing.",
		"He realized that their fighting spirit was at a low, and disciplinary measures could only accomplish so much. So he sent an envoy",
		"|The next week, they were marching together|",

		"Patient 1000",

		"Patient 1000 is a woman approximately 16 years of age from Stulpika. She was found by 19th 'Pervaya Tambovskaya' division's medical battalion lying uncounscious in a field and given summary examination.",
		"Patient unresponsive, background and comorbidities indeterminable. Shows numerous open lesions on the forearms, arms, thighs, shins and abdomen, open right femural fracture (translative type), gunshot wound to the abdomen with purulent infection and seminal fluid in various places. Vital signs present, BP and respiatory rate diminished(100/70 and 10/minute).",
		"|Diagnosis: Decompensated acute anemia caused by post-traumatic blood loss. Treatment unnecessary, euthanasia recommended.|",

		"No",

		"As Nierenstein was being pounded by wave after wave of artillery, Kargit High Command realized that the collapse of its defenses was imminent and only a swift counterattack was the only chance to gain any more time from that desperate situation. They sent order for the men to brace themselves for a 'bold offensive'.",
		"|Anton Pavlov put the pistol inside his own mouth and fired|",

		"The Dogtor",

		"This happened during Operation Harpoon, when Somertin was pushing the Kargits out of Blachia. Argeseanu ordered an assault over a certain sector, and seventy thousand men charged the enemy trenches. Because of poor coordination they were repelled by machinegun and artillery fire, fifteen thousand of them could not retreat, but because of overwhelming air support neither could the kargits countercharge to ensure they were dead.",

		"Then, a dog jumped from the somertin trenches and sprinted towards where the wounded lay. Azorel, his name, wore a white kerchief painted with the red cross on him and carried a box of morphin pills in his mouth. He ran around too fast for the kargits to care to waste bullets on him and found a soldier whose name we now know to be LazƒÉr Ciurea. This man took one pill and wrapped the dog's kerchief around his wounded ankle, then got up to try to walk back towards his lines",

		"Immediately, three kargit machineguns no more than eight hundred meters from him were trained on his position, ready to end him once and for all. But an artillery shell, as if guided by God himself, cratered the ground at such an angle that a cloud of dust flew five meters high and three wide, and the kargit machineguns could no longer get an idea of where exactly he was until he descended the hill and was out of their sight.",

An impeccably coordinated paradrop on the east bank while the west bank would be ran down by the armored spearhead. Assuming a collapse of the Somertin armed forces, this would have been the crowning jewel of their victories. <br><br> And for the first two weeks it looked like it would truly be that way. The paradrops gunned down their way into occupying two entire factory complexes, the initial thrust sped over a third of the west bank and reached the Eagleland Friendship Park where brutal hand-to-hand fighting began. <br><br> But the White Army never collapsed, never surrendered, and credit to the White Guards, moved not one step back from that. <br> From the line they reached, they could not press further except maybe one or two streets that they could not hold and would abandon shortly. Since Kaula was declared Fortress Citadel, and the battle a Sacred Crusade, there was no way it could fail. Every inch of soil was to be planted, every child, woman and elder would man the guns, work three shifts or build fortifications, and every man 14 or above was to be incorporated. <br><br> The tipping point was the Seventeenth battle of the Park, where White Guards reinforced by armor and artillery had taken the entirety of its surface, with local opposing units too understrenght to oppose it. <br> From then on it went further downhill for the Kargits, and the skies cleared for the Somertins. <br> Twenty-third morning of the battle, a deafening explosion thundered. The Mighty Sibir had come in range, and so have the Transkalite Riflemen. The material, numeric and moral advantage rested firmly in the Whites's hands. By thundering cannonades, strafes and unending waves of machinegun fire, the Kargits died in droves, those lucky enough to survive hiding terrified in their trenches, no courage to lift the heads over the edge for fear of the Grey Snipers.<br><br> And then extraurban units of the Riflemen and White Guards began executing a pincer assault on the body of the Kargit salient. When the first company crossed their horizon, the Kargit forces (who were living on the delusion that they were almost done and that the Whites would quickly break ranks) woke up to the grim reality that there will be no capitulation. <br> Their order to shorten the salient, while being outflanked on both sides and fired at by the Sibir, caused panic. Panic turned to chaos and the Kargit spearhead collapsed. It did not take long for them to find themselves encircled, and desperation set in. A few tried to fight with whatever was left, but the majority threw down their arms and begged to be sent to the camps. <br> Twenty-eigth morning of the battle, the siege is lifted, the people of Kaula get relieved from their duties and a hundred thousand prisoners-of-war ride trains eastward. <br> Kaula held firm. Somertin punched back. And though many of our people are behind enemy line, suffering unspeakable travesties, soon enough they will be free. <br><br> And the Kargits will pay <br><br>Terribly",
	"CHAPTER_INTERLOGUE_SOMERTIN_C2": "At 8:00, two thousand artillery bores and a thousand bombers began an extensive bombardment over the kargit-occupied Patna, and at 9:00 troops on makeshift rafts began attempts of crossing the river. This threw the kargits off who did not expect us to coordinate a bombardment so effectively, or to try to cross the river. It caught them with their pants down and gave Anders an opportunity to strike the bridgeheads at full force. The kargits, overextended, did not manage to either prevent them from taking the bridgeheads or to realize what their true intention was.<br><br>When Anders cast the White Guards and tanks he held in reserve to a relentless, brutal assault, the kargits failed to shuffle troops accordingly and got shamefully encircled inside a citadel for the second time.<br><br>A fierce, merciless battle for the already ruined citadel began; with Somertin troops charging to their deaths towards kargit machineguns; and kargits getting blown to bits by the furious artillery and air bombardment. For two months the city became a living hell among the intense gunfire, incendiary bombs and three thousand artillery barrels firing day-round.<br><br>At the end, over a million men adorned the pavement with their blood and organs; the kargits losing slightly more than the Somertins being a fantastic humiliation due to their smaller population pool. They went into the afterlife escorted by more than a hundred thousand civilians who died to collateral damage or willful wartime brutality. And Patna, once the third greatest city in all of Somertin, stood in ruins; burning incessantly; thousands shouting in agony.<br><br>In the heart of the average Kargit, Patna was akin to pure horror. Kaula was lost due to a tactical mistake; but Patna was lost in brutal, direct, no-holds-barred battle against an enemy they thought to be on the losing end but who was very much hitting back and hitting with a furious fervor. Their hearts, for the first time in decades, felt fear.<br><br>We have won. A brutal, pyrrhic victory, but a victory nonetheless. We have shown the godless barbarians that we could defeat them in a fair fight and that we can dictate the flow of battle. Somertin shall not bow to their miserly yoke, now or ever, and though the war of national liberation will be long we will eventually prevail.<br><br>No matter what it takes",
	"CHAPTER_INTERLOGUE_SOMERTIN_C3": "It hasn't been long since Metropolispolis was Polasie's jewel and one of the greatest commerce hubs in the world. Millions of pounds sterling exchanging hands; myriads of tons of goods moving in and out of it, various services being performed daily. Those who remember it at its peak knew of a city bustling with hustle and bustle.<br><br>All that went to shit<br><br>As if the naval blockade wasn't bad enough the civil war caused untold misery; with the militias summarily executing those they deemed 'traitors' or 'nazis', requisitioning the people's food or blowing up necessary infrastructure. The Pearl of the Farther Orient, as it was called before the war, is aflame. The people scurry like rats to make a miserable living; killing or prostituting themselves for scraps of food; a bag of common flour being about as luxurious as one could realistically find.<br><br>When we landed our assault force, it was... anticlimactic? The propaganda made them all expect a genocidal warband of savages who would rape, pillage and slaughter maniacally; the reality was very different. Certainly some units acted like ruffians, but the citizens tended to always seek the protection of the White Guards for they acted with remarkable chivalry.<br><br>At least 200.000 of the five million people of Metropolispolis perished to the violence or the famine and many more suffered greatly, but quick intervention prevented a worse scenario from happening.<br><br>With half their homeland fallen; Polasie tried a final battle on the sea hoping for a second Medang; but they stood no chance to our revitalized navy. Admiralissimo Spruce's brilliant strategiery saw them humilliated. And without their vaunted navy, their last hope, they capitulated unconditionally. Finally, one of our three enemies croaked. The weakest, most pathetic of them, but it is one front we will no longer have to manage. And in the future, one more people we will have guided towards the Light",

But the great glory of triumph goes to Marshal Hans, who busted over the mountain passes, took the heavily-fortified city of Patna and brought Marshal Vladov as well as Kuzmich and their deputies in cages.<br><br>We might not have been able to secure what the initial plans envisioned. The Whites did not collapse yet, and the capital is not yet in our hands. But not to worry, soon enough those too will fall, as will everything that opposes the rule of the superior race. <br> For now, pacification of the occupied lands has proven troublesome, but slowly, carefully, we will break their will with sufficient application of force.<br><br>The reactionary subhumans will fall. The superior race will win. And we will have our egalitarian utopia!",
	"CHAPTER_INTERLOGUE_KARGIT_C2": "The NERVE on these beasts! First they deny us our rightful claims, then they fight tooth and nail for every fucking street and doorsill as if they want to spite us with every fucking millivolt of their energy. We couldn't even take a fucking piss without fearing that some bastard would chop our dick from the corner of some damn street. Persistent animals these somertins are, defiant to the fucking end. After the overexertion they put us through, they won't even give us the satisfaction of savouring victory! How can we amuse ourselves if they evacuate all valuables, consume all the food and booze and if the women keep killing themselves before we can grab them?<br><br>Either way, we have conquered their capital and crushed the nexus of their primitive superstitions; and still we stand at firepower parity. Victory is guaranteed; though a bit more costly than expected. It's only a matter of time now",
	"CHAPTER_INTERLOGUE_KARGIT_C3": "Four long years and many, many dead but it is finally done. We have driven altroughout the beast's lair and vanquished them in all corners of their nation. They put up a brutal fight which we feel obligated to commend them on, but were no match to our iron will and superior tactics.<br><br>We trampled the fields of Sopvon and downed their planes; shot their trucks. Crushed the tanks made in Bakraka and chased away their navy from Meglev. Even Ia»ô, the steel heart of their nation, we pulled it mercilessly and crushed it with ten thousand artillery bores.<br><br>Though they still hold the Redoubt, we have won and made them our bitches. The first and greatest trophy on our wall<br><br>Some reorganisation is still needed for them to know their new place; but that too shall be done",

Rather than oppress us, it would've seemed more pragmatic to turn against their former allies as they are closer. <br><br>We were wrong. Terribly wrong. Not one, not two, but all those who fight Somertin have disrespected us. Not only attacking us without the most formal or fallacious declaration of war, but attempting to assassinate the Queen herself.Willingly or unwillingly, we find ourselves at war with the Polasians, Elamites and Kargits, together with the Somertins. <br><br>And what a kicking we gave them! The sons of the taiga hugged their motherland tight and kicked the invaders back into the sea! Glory to the Commonwealth, glory to the Queen!<br><br>Now that our shores and borders are secure, we must ride on to help our allies against these perfidious snakes. Let it be known, no-one is more lucky than he who is friend to the people of Transkal!",
	"CHAPTER_INTERLOGUE_TRANSKAL_C2": "Down the Spring Boulevard in Odenshagen, an armored car drove alone for there weren't many others in all of Transkal. In it was Her Majesty and the car was among the first batch produced locally.<br><br>They arrived to bless the city's first crown-sponsored school; built over the ruins of some cottages torched by the Elamites. Her Majesty knew that a modern industry requires engineers and educated operators; so a reformed education system was necessary. Out of the Royal Exchequer she did so; she spent lavishly to build schools, hospitals, manufactures and infrastructure projects.<br><br>Aware that she did not have a 'knack' for rulership, she felt acceptable to imitate what Chromit was doing in his own nation and within the following months she toured other factories, schools and barracks. The people, who up to that point had at most heard her voice once in a single radio address, were astonished to be in her presence. Most only heard that she represented some sort of divine lineage or another, or that she was at odds with the steward generals that they didn't like. All of them were struck by a sense of reverence towards the young queen who carried herself with sacrosanctity, unknowing that her withdrawn expression was due to her feeling uncomfortable interacting with unknown people. It worked in her favour; the people saw in her 'the one who will wring the necks of the steward general-warlords'<br><br>But she dreaded what would come. Building things with the Royal Exchequer's money or what Somertin donated did not ruffle any feathers. Land reforms, however, would cause a giant stink. Something that she had to do but had no easy way to. But it was too late to turn back, she had to cross the Rubicon",
	"CHAPTER_INTERLOGUE_TRANSKAL_C3": "At first they sent fake reports that they were still at the front; then Gustav asked Laszlo who dispelled the lie. But they were gone. They marched all the way back to southern Transkal and while the Queen ordered their own to go back they could not outpace them; worse still the Meglev-Jylla railways were clogged with transporting troops for a new offensive against Polasie.<br><br>General Vukvol came just in clutch to stop the shmelevites from taking the palace and the northern half of the Demesne; even with the coup d'etat barely averted the situation was ugly. Transkal was in open rebellion while also involved in a major war and dependent on its bigger, stronger neighbour<br><br>Without the possibility of calling the somertins to aid (for fear of them gaining any more leverage than they already had), the Queen has to garb herself in equal measures of velvet and steel if she wants Transkal to survive this crisis.<br><br>Some strategic application of goodwill shall do wonders; but some necks will have to adorn the gallows if anything is to be done at all.",

The oilfields have been flawlessly taken by the Marines, before they could be sabotaged. Those that were disabled soon will be repaired with 'free'-willing workhand.<br><br>At home the crowds cheer, excited that justice against the fascists is forthcoming. Prosperity, however, is more swift to come. Already we have shipped in some nazi refugees who are excited to do the low-level labour in exchange for the promise of freedom. They have been properly disciplined, the terrorists from among them have been interned in compulsory 'humanist' classes to accept their denazification.<br><br>Casualties have been astonishing. Fifty thousand young men have given their lives for freedom, but such number would terrify the people at home. So we'll ask the CYA to truncate these to a more tolerable 5.000. <br><br>Rejoice, Mr. President! The economy is improving and the nazis are being driven away. Reelection is certain.",
	"CHAPTER_INTERLOGUE_POLASIE_C2": "The battle for freedom is going fantastically! We have liberated the oilfields of Moh and the tungsten-chromium mines of Baduzh and the president has won reelection! The people feel like victory against the gypsy nazi fascist commie terrorists is coming soon!<br><br>Army high command, however, has a different opinion. They see that our advance has stalled and does not continue; worse still we are losing skirmishes and the kargit advance has been reverted. Certain voices called for us to end the war, which we tried but was refused categorically.<br><br>Perhaps the enemy has a comeback planned and if them amassing as many troops as they had so far is anything to go by; it will be serious",

The past month has brought nothing but fear and misery, trouble we don't seem to have a way to extricate ourselves from.<br><br>We lost merchant vessels left and right, were driven out of Transkal and lost Bernard's entire army in Somertin; then for the first time suffered invasion on our home soil as the nazis occupied Valeria Island. More than 200.000 men captured or dead; half of our army gone just like that in a month.<br><br>And if you think that's the end of it you're in for a nasty surprise; decades of factional tensions ruptured into the state collapsing to civil war, right as the enemy is at our gates<br><br>There's no sugarcoating this, the situation is really bad. We're hoping for a miraculous naval victory like Medang, but with the navy being sliced across party lines, we are not so sure that could happen... It really is that bad",

The Eigth Army is a shell of its former self and short as it was, our offensive still led us over the border. The Sultan has led us into the kaffir's lands, and we will fight until the day of triumph.<br><br>With a fist from our Kargit brothers, and another from the Sultan, the White monstrosity will be chopped down.<br><br>And when it does, Elam will abound in riches. Gold, machinery, women, everything. We will rejoice, and we will celebrate. Praise to the Sultan, as mighty as his father Faruk.

The Sassafras front advanced at snail's pace before being stopped dead in its tracks. Even worse, the Shahar front is not only frozen(not even skirmishes showing any success) but we are staring at the kaffir gathering more and more forces against us. At first they reached parity, then they built more and more railways, and now they are bringing more and more tanks and heavy equipment.<br><br>We are staring down the barrels of their cannons, with depleted arsenals and exhausted men. It is only a matter of time until they launch a fearsome counterattack. May Shallah protect us when that day comes.",
	"CHAPTER_INTERLOGUE_ELAM_C3": "All our bravery could do in front of the curtains of fire and brimstone was hold on desperately. The advances we made with bitter fighting and sacrifices were reverted; just like that we were driven back 300Km behind our own borders. Those who could remember the dreadful feeling of defeat during the Sassafras War are forced to live through a humiliation worse and more callous.<br><br>They outnumber us in men and materiel, and are incensed to destroy us at any price while our polasian allies are down and the kargits won't do anything to save our skin.

Now that they are trying to cross the river Presus, we find ourselves outnumbered and outgunned, units thrown in disarray. The arrival of the experienced general Vladov will not save the disaster, but it will buy precious time for us to fully mobilize.",

We had expected the Polasians to be perfidious and not help us, but we did not foresee them invading in our darkest hour. At dusk they came like burglars and savagely destroyed part of our fleet while still in harbour, then landed marines and set them on course to the oilfields of Moh. General Stoyan must take the reins of the situation and keep them north of the Moh River.",

Our units are struggling to hold the line against the kargit onslaught. With the bastards outside the proud city of Patna and poised to assault, General Vladov has decided to make a stand in his homeland. Fortifications, entrenchments and flooded sectors will ensure that the bastards will pay for each meter of Vladov's home in blood. For if it fell, the Kargits would have clear way to the capital. That cannot be allowed!",

Now the bastards are at the gates of our capital forcing their way into the sacred citadel, killing and torching left and right. But this time we will not retreat even one step back. For Somertin, for God and for everything that is good, drive out the criminals! Kaula will stand!",

Moreover, the splendid counterattack saw a hundred thousand men and the best 1000 kargit tanks, the proverbial tip of their lance, surrounded and cut off from the main army. Marshal Hryniuk will be given the honor of crushing the pocket once and for all. Meanwhile, on the southern front, Dumitrescu wants as much of Interriverana liberated as it's possible.

The Kargit command, despite brilliant preparation, had to respond to multiple somertin schwerpunkts and expended a huge deal of its reserves. Taking advance of the tempo, Anders aims to launch an armored assault and envelop the city of Patna, securing it before the Kargits can fortify it and use it as a bastion. He resolves to win this not only for the obvious strategic value, but also in honour of Vladov who fought bravely to stall the enemy onslaught.",

Somertin learned to group their own submarines as well, and to send capital ships to disperse the ASW screeners. This way, the submarine warfare has escalated, almost to a direct confrontation that the polasians want to avoid and the somertins to expedite. The heroic struggle of the little SFN Piorun has bought enough time for the strike force to arrive. Face-to-face are now the SFN KETER and PSS Sol, Somertin and Polasie's strongest battleships. Polasie has been forced into its first pitched naval battle",
    "MISSION_DESC_SOMERTIN_C3_M2": "Taking advantage of their naval superiority and in order to solve the issue that their supply of submarines were dwindling, Somertin Naval High Command has decided to launch an amphibious assault on Valeria Island.

Marshal Stoyan is overjoyed at having the Polasian army even more starved and agrees to lead the ground aspect of this campaign.",

Ahead is the White Army that keeps whittling them down, and behind is a population that is unwilling to support the war effort. The situation has been even more dire since the submarine raids began as ammunition was beginning to dwindle. Now that Valeria Island has been lost and the raids intensified, Polasian troops have began to even lack basic food. Their morale is at an all-time low and Marshal Stoyan prepares to end them once and for all",

However it backfired since long-buried resentments had fulminated. Red and Blue militias are tearing the country apart, seeing eachother as the enemy and Somertin merely as a secondary issue. This foolishness of theirs has left the front door open, and General Stoyan is gearing up to euthanise their pathetic army.",

Their only hope is that their outnumbered navy manages a miraculous decisive victory then sinks the supply convoy to our invading force just like we've done to theirs. Being their last hope of denying the reality that the war is lost, we absolutely must destroy their navy here.

And then these reactionaries will be civilized, and we shall redistribute their assets fairly to all people. (Which they are not because they are subhumans).

Besting such a formidable fortress will not be an easy task even for the invincible Kargit Army.",
    "MISSION_DESC_KARGIT_C2_M1": "Time is precious for the Kargit forces. Doubly so for Marshal Hans who has to drive his armored spearhead into hopefully capturing Kaula, while his rear is unsecure. Patna had been enveloped, sure, but the rail-lines do not bypass it, and the city had not been captured fully either. Knowing that the spearhead must keep thrusting deeper, Khuzov wants Kulik to reinforce Hans's rear and secure his supply lines.",

Usually, such operation would only be performed if it was secure to, but the Kargits do not have the luxury of picking fronts. They have to maintain constant pushes in order to not lose the strategic initiative. Bela will recieve commands to pick up Kulik's share and manage the southern front. While also advancing.",
    "MISSION_DESC_KARGIT_C2_M3": "While the southern front has advanced deep into Interriverana, it has not advanced broadly. Marshal Khuzov has long slept uneasy, fearing that while they divert the bulk of the supplies northwartds to try and take Kaula, the Whites may scheme a counterattack against the moronic Bela. Worse still, after Kulik finished his ordeal in Patna, he was struck by a bout of heart attack, so there is no way of knowing when is he returning. With few options, Khuzov decided to go and take personal command of Kulik's forces.",

    "MISSION_DESC_KARGIT_C2_M5": "The Kargit army has advanced thousands of kilometers, and since Marshal Hans's last offensive the periphery of West Kaula is within sight. Taking the fortified citadel will be a herculean task, as the Kargit offensive is quickly approaching its Clausewitzian culmination. Khuzov has arranged for massive quantities of armor and materiel to be delivered to Hans's front, for what will be the toughest and most decisive offensive of the war. The Kargit Empire shall rise or fall, and that will be decided by the result of this very operation.",
    "MISSION_DESC_KARGIT_C3_M1": "It is done, the Somertins have commited their reserves to the citadel of Kaula. They had done so, assuming that the river flanks are secure enough to not be breached. A foolish assumption that will be their downfall",

It is time for a joint effort to break this pocket completely. With the fall of their capital, the morale of the white roaches will collapse and they will accept their masters.",

    "MISSION_DESC_POLASIE_C3_M4": "This mission happened almost a full month before the last one. Exasperated that it has been a long time where he has dealt no finishing blow to the Svelgers, General Pykot's impatience grew and grew. And the shewd old Gustav knew to play this to his advantage.

Worse still, we will have to cross over defensible barriers such as the great Shahar River or the Khandahar Mountains to advance. If the attack is to succeed, the first and most shocking offensive must take place over the Khandahar Mountains by the most experienced general, otherwise the advance will not be possible at all. Grand Vizier Mutasarif shall lead a diversion over the Mica River, to create an illusion.",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C1_M2": "Mutasarif's crossing of the Mica was a trick on General Laszlo, one that he bit hook, line and sinker. Now that the anvil is ready, Esfahani will be the hammer.",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C1_M3": "With the success of Ibrahim Esfahani's push, the enemy has had to weaken their forces from the Shahar segment. Perfect for Ali, who has to capture at least fourteen bridgeheads over this long segment.",

Everything is going according to keikaku.The Sultan wants them eliminated, to show that the Empire is capable of bewegungskrieg just like the Kargi. Translator's note: 'keikaku' means plan",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C2_M1": "Laszlo had escaped the encirclement. Although it may be too late, Mutasarif wants to try one final time to capture him and prevent him from being a thorn in the side later on",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C2_M2": "Due to a desire to at best force Transkalite capitulation or at worst delay them from reinforcing Somertin, we had decided to launch an amphibious assault into Jylla. Ostentively also to earn some esteem for Elam as a navally-capable regional power.",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C2_M3": "With the Mica sector closed and Mutasarif moving eastwards, Esfahani leads his own push to make common front with the kargits and shorten the outrageously long frontline",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C2_M4": "Odenshagen is in sight, and although Krystof has lost many men Shmelev is soon coming to his aid. With his limited forces, Hassan must take the jyllan polis before the momentum swings against him. Time is of the essence",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C2_M5": "Krystof did manage to fortify the polis, but the way from it to the port is a frozen rivulet that couldn't be secured as thoroughly. Precisely where Shmelev and the reconsolidated Krystof want to hit and leave Hassan stranded and without supplies, in grave danger of losing his good-quality troops and their materiel",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C3_M1": "In the past few months, Laszlo and Argeseanu's salient had rebecome active, pushing back the Kargit south front. They now stand 200Km away from the Mica River and Esfahani had to move his forces back there in order to solidify the defense of the mountain line. The detachment sent ahead on recon have unfortunately stumbled upon the Somertin vanguard. Esfahani orders the outnumbered recon units to delay the enemy's advance so he can dig in and defend the mountain line",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C3_M2": "Esfahani's decision to fortify the passes had turned out to be wise. The enemy has indeed come to storm their position. They have superiority in air and armor but Ibrahim believes that with the help of local militias and well-placed AMPAC's, they can hold them back. He is, however, worried as to what this means for the future.",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C3_M3": "Battered, frozen and demoralized, the contingent of troops that Hassan landed in Jylla found itself overwhelmed. With their objective long past accomplished, Hassan felt that it was time to bring them back home.",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C3_M4": "It was expected of the south flotillas of the Transkalite Navy to be green water ships; that meaning ships with short range of action. Worse still, no one in the world thought it possible to sail the northern flotillas through the Kolguyev Pass to bring them to the southern naval theater. Hassan's navy, docked in Makka for refueling and repair, is thus up for one nasty surprise.",
    "MISSION_DESC_ELAM_C3_M5": "With Somertin's offensive against Kandahar's passes stopped heroically by Esfahani's heroic struggle, the Sultan saw fit to turn to diplomacy with Somertin's theater commander, General Laszlo. Unknowing to him, their position was way weaker than they thought...",

	"Millions of square kilometers, inhabited by hundreds of millions of people all of different ethnicity, language or religion. Somertin is the largest and most powerful nation on the continent. And abounding in resources, culture and wealth, it's a beautiful nation. Everyone knows utopia can never exist, but decent societies surely can and Somertin is surprisingly functional considering its size and conditions; quite a decent place to be in. As long as one pays his dues and doesn't start trouble, they recieve the state's protection and benefits. Trying to describe the way it works is like trying to find the kernel of an onion; Somertin politics are a mystery wrapped inside an enigma, with a complex but surprisingly reliable way of doing things. It comes off as obvious that such a vast and rich nation would be envied by its neighbours. That they'd seek to devour it. And when a series of tragedies brought the giant to its knees, the vultures smelled blood. Their cursed hordes are, as we speak, thrusting deep into the Motherland's tender nether regions while comitting the most vile travesties on our people. We desired no war, but if war is imposed upon us we'll fight without fear and without mercy! March on brothers, shoulder to shoulder against the Devil himself! We will not rest, we will not stop until the foundries of Hell are closed, until peace reigns supreme, and justice for the innocents triumphs!",
	"Ten thousand years ago, the Race of the Evening Star had an empire that stretched as wide as the entire world and their technology was incredibly advanced. Having laser obelisks that would communicate with the annunaki of Nibiru. Their civilisation was brought to an end by the reptilian barbarian hordes of various tribes who would not even know to wipe their ass if our ancestors didn't teach them. Their last surviving descendants are we, the Kargi. Once more, we are the world's capital of culture, art and industry. But we lack two things: resources and living space. The best ways to procure them is to dispose of the somertin and transkalite pests, and take what rightfully belongs to us. Sure, we are in a temporary alliance with the morons of Polasie and the barbarians of Elam, but they too will be made to serve us. Join us, comrade! Join us as we drive our superpanzers to the four corners of the world! Let's show these barbarians the meaning of power!",
	"The vast lands of that which lies beyond the Kal mountains belong to us, the Transkal Commonwealth. I say 'lands' instead of 'country' because we never were a centralized queendom. Great taigas and mountains separate the various states which are ruled by local strongmen instead of answering to the Queen. The Queen is the symbolic ruler of the nation according to our religion and traditions, but rarely in history has a queen had authority. Many were put on the throne specifically for their lack of desire to get involved in actually running the nation. Not Queen Vanessa, however. Her mother had fought the lords for decades so that the nation could be pulled into the industrial age. And had the world been different, she'd have done the same. But not with the Kargits openly declaring they want to exterminate the people of Transkal and Somertin, and especially not when their Polasian and Elamite allies have already crossed the border and attacked us. The drums of war are thundering loudly from the west, and whether we want it or not war is upon the Commonwealth. We must preserve our culture and traditions against the storm of steel that is coming!",
	"Freedom! Liberty! Emancipation! These are the core tenets of the Polasie Republic. A republic from the people, of the people, for the people. We shall fight for freedom against the fascist communist terrorist gypsies of Somerthing, and against the other communist nazi sympathizers of Transkal. Their oppression of our freedom-loving nation knows no bounds, as they refuse to let us use their resources in order to bring prosperity and happiness to our people. Thus, we must denazify these terror-states alongside the brave freedom fighters of Kargi and the noble jihadists of Elam. Come with us, friend. Let's fight for freedom!",
	"No more than a year ago, the Elamite Empire celebrated both its greatest achievement and its greatest sorrow. Sultan Faruk III has valiantly defeated the Akkadian Tribe Confederation and unified the Elam Subcontinent under his sword. Unfortunately for the jubilant nation, he died to a severe renal infection less than two months later, unable to properly revel in his glory. Subsequently, a power struggle erupted between the minor Prince, merely 15 at the time, and Grand Vizier Mutasarif. The struggle was broken when an important general bid his loyalty to the Prince, and threatened the Grand Vizier to submit. Now this Vizier is totally and absolutely loyal to the young Prince. Without a doubt. The young Prince, now crowned and blessed as Sultan, is naive and idealistic about his position in the world. It doesn't help one bit that he grew up hearing heroic tales of his father's deeds, and that he is foolish enough to believe he can imitate him oh-so-easily. He believes that when he leads, others will follow. He believes that when he attacks, the enemy will retreat. And he believes that he will be obeyed on account of his divine heritage.But what better way to secure your position, earn glory and postpone internal tensions than to march against a weakened neighbour who is already at war with half the world? Golden opportunity, and a foolishness to pass up on. So, with the power of Allah and Anime on his side, the (very) young Sultan is ready to kick some ass!",
	"Were you a hero, you'd fight until the last drop of blood. And you'd proudly die for your nation. For your family. For your honor as a man. The rest of us... are not heroes. We are nothing but human, subject to fear and failure. We who would rather live for the nation, are not anywhere close to you. We sold our dignity already. We who made ourselves worms, do not complain when we're trodden on. With shame we shall fight for those who are butchering our loved ones. We'll serve them and thus earn their trust. And when the time comes, we'll shank them where they are most vulnerable. We'll pay them back for everything they've done to us and avenge the loss of what we hold dear. Do not join us, for you deserve better.",
	"Those they call 'subhumans' are those that plow their fields. Who labour for their warmachine so that they have bullets to shoot our own families. Of our fat they make soap, and from our skin they make lamps. All for a war so that more of our people can be subjected to this fate. What is left for us, brother? Nothing but suffering. Nothing but backbreaking labour under their whips. Brothers, why do we let ourselves be led like cattle to the slaughter? Rise up against the cogs of evil! Rise up against their cursed empire! They whip us now, tomorrow it will be us who whip them! Rise with us, brother! We'll march towards the dim and fading lights, and sooner welcome death than be slaves again!",
	"For generations, the Commonwealth of Transkal has been ruled by a Queen who would preside over the affairs of the common people. It is this belief in a matriarch that defines our tradition, and the cornerstone to our religion. That Queen Vanessa wants to stomp over this sacred tradition and submit herself to a male ruler, is unacceptable. We'd be absorbed by our much bigger neighbour and cease to be independent and unique. General Shmelev has struck a deal with the Kargits. They will allow us to keep our ways if we rise up and oppose the rule of the fake queen. Now we know the way, and we'll fight for the dauphine Queen Isabella! For the matriarchy!",
	"Is it fair that the rich capitalists get to have cars while the common man makes less than 15 dollars an hour!? Is this fair that the minorities, women and LBGTQ+ people have to bear microagressions while the majority gets to bask in their privilege? We need equality! We need freedom! We need communism! Together with you, comrade, we'll topple the white cis-normative racist patriarchy and bring true freedom and equality to everyone under communism!",
	"What happens when a stupid, snot-nosed child with delusions of grandeur rules an entire empire? Disaster. That's what happens. All our gains from the initial phase were lost when the enemy counterattacked, and now the battle is going in our own lands. We can hardly keep them at bay when our industry is so limited, and the soldiers so tired. Luckily the Grand Vizier is pragmatic enough to see the way the wind is blowing. If we reach an agreement with the somertins, we can end this foolish war and avoid their retribution."

				//Vythmik militias assembling
				["Vladov","Two weeks of basic training and bolt rifles.",
				"Vladov"," I almost feel bad for these boys but we have to do all we can; we must buy more time",
				"Kovner","Awaiting your orders, Field Marshal",
				"Vladov","Begin marching westwards to the frontline, you must hold the kargits at bay for as long as possible.",
				"Vladov","Do not think surrender is an option, the kargits will show you no mercy. Your home is in peril now more than ever, vythmik boys. To arms!"],

				//Presus bridges detonated
				["Vladov","Fire!",
				"Narrator","Somertin artillery aimed at the Presus bridges and fired a cannonade, completely destroying both.",
				"Vladov","Kargit engineers will fix them in about a week or so. But it is a week we have gained for ourselves.",
				"Kovner","Field Marshal, our entrenchments are stormed with impunity and my men cannot offer but the faintest opposition. Please allow us to retreat eastwards",
				"Vladov","Retreat where? Into the Anin Great Plains? This indiscretion will allow the kargits to flank and destroy them with ease",
				"Kovner","We have a small window-",
				"Vladov","Your boys will not move one kilometer back, not even a single step. Any retreat is strictly forbidden until we have obtained permission from the Generalissimo.",
				"Vladov","Even if it costs you your lives, you will hold your ground!"],

				//Iberic militias assembling
				["Narrator","[Anders broadcasted a radio message for all the people of the region to hear. He began by blowing a horn, loudly enough that even those who were in the fields working could hear]",
				"Anders","Arise, iberics. Barbarians are at the gates!",
				"Anders","Are you all aware of what they did to the Albinians? Those millions they butchered and chased out of their own nation for not abandoning the true faith and not bowing to kargitist insanity?",
				"Ruben","That which he speaks, iberics, is what I lived trough. They had done this to us, they will do it to you as well. To you and the vythmiks, and the panerians, the stulpikans and many more",
				"Anders","Only you can prevent this; will you let them do to you what they want or will you stand up and fight?",
				"Anders","Worry not for arms, we will equip you. Worry not for food, we will feed you. Rise up and stand tall against the barbarians, now or never!",
				"Dumitrescu","How did it go?",
				"Ruben","Tens of thousands have taken rifles, and Anders assigned them to my command.",
				"Dumitrescu","Good. These militias will buy us time to reinforce",
				"Ruben","Militias they may be, but they are iberics. Familiar with the Petric mountains and eating boar, many akin to transkalite riflemen in skill.",
				"Anders","Had we enough time to make it a Military District, the kargits would have been facing a million snipers from the mountains",
				"Dumitrescu","We will make do with what we have."],

				//Hevan militias assembling
				["Stoyan","HC, I have managed to raise three brigades of hevan militias. It wasn't easy, I can tell you that",
				"Dumitrescu","That's to be expected. Poor Broz did his best to raise an army for Heva, only to get it encircled and destroyed by the kargits in the opening phase of the war",
				"Stoyan","I know. That's what? Five percent of the entire male population, gone just like that. The entire region felt it, they're still mourning their boys. Add insult to injury, now the polasians are invading. And we come to tell these people to take up arms again",
				"Dumitrescu","At least it's the polasians, and time is on our side. Eventually we'll assemble the bakrakans, the meglevites, the thraks and even the golubujans. Until then you have to hold the line",
				"Stoyan","Understood. And I'll shuffle my troops, maybe I can get more hevan boys home",
				"Dumitrescu","Pointless sentimentality. Whether you get bakrakans or hevans or anyone else killed, it's still somertin boys. Better you lead them well and attack with energy and determination; it gets the enemy beaten faster and saves more lives overall",
				"Stoyan","I don't think I can imitate the same degree of ferocity as Laszlo, Anders, Hryniuk or others",
				"Dumitrescu","I know. That's why you're on the north front. I just hoped you'd understand something",
				"Dumitrescu","Either way, I have faith in your capabilities. Good luck to you"],

				//Panerian militias assembling
				["Broz","Puric, you dumb son of a bitch! Idiot stulpikans and their regionalism!",
				"Broz","Fuck it, it is what it is.",
				"Broz","People of Panere, we are in this shit together. Rise up if you don't want to become cattle for the kargits! We have guns for you to wield if you have the balls; come and fight these bastards with me!",
				"Kulik","The cockroaches are padding the line with cheap militias and reinforce-memeing us. It's making it incredibly annoying to liquidate this pocket",
				"Khuzov","See the silver lining to this situation. More 'free-willing workers' for our 'collective revolutionary industrial enterprises'.",
				"Kulik","Alright. Tell Reddit to rate THIS encirclement"],

				//Raising the Honour Guard
				["Narrator","Somertin's ruling elite, up to the Paradygmist, gathered in a warehouse close to the city center. Dumitrescu attended as the ceremonially-necessary witness and the queen of Transkal came out of curiosity",
				"Dumitrescu","I've had my men bring the guard gear y'all needed. Now let's get this ceremony over with so I hope you won't all recite that pompous ancient oath. This is a warzone, not a parliament.",
				"Chromit","You aren't usually this antsy, Petru",
				"Dumitrescu","Raising a guard banner out of almost all the nation's politicians and sending it into battle is IMMENSELY daunting. One small mistake and our administrative capacity is crippled for years",
				"Chromit","That's why tradition demands us to name successors. We've even had the plebiscites done last month",
				"Dumitrescu","Convenient, but it doesn't completely solve the issue. Let's hope everything goes well",
				"Kovacs","Sword in hand, I saddle for the realm. A paladin of the Lord-",
				"Dumitrescu","Faster please, your Excellency. Four hundred men saying this oath and we'll be here all day.",
				"Kovacs","Very well. Sword in hand I stand tall, so help me God.", 
				"Kovacs","Cardinal Rancane shall be my successor. The war will end and we will triumph, of this I have no doubt. And to rebuild and consolidate thereafter I want a merciful, saintly man and no-one but him suffices.",
				"Borisov","Sword in hand I stand tall, so help me God.",
				"Borisov","For Bakraka's throne I will have my son Paul succeed me if the Lord wants to take me",
				"Michael","Sword in hand I stand tall, so help me God.",
				"Michael","Everyone knows what a horse is, my successor is obviously my cousin.",
				"Chromit","Sword in hand I stand tall, so help me God.",
				"Chromit","Were I to fall, I want the Generalissimo to take the other 9 years of my mandate. The war will be our greatest struggle and none but him would suit this hour",
				"Dumitrescu","I am honoured, but daunted by the responsibility",
				"Dragalina","Rifle in hand I stand tall, so help me providence.",
				"Dragalina","As for the successor... well there's Bogza and Sokolska I had in mind",
				"Chromit","It's Sokolska, isn't it?",
				"Dragalina","Look, Dumitrescu, Chromit. That Bogza is a loose cannon, I know that guy's type, I can handle him to get him to function but Sokolska isn't the kind. She's not ready and probably won't be for a decade or so.",
				"Dragalina","My point is, I leave Sokolska as my successor but I want y'all to liquidate Bogza if I were to kick the bucket. He'd have outlived his usefulness",
				"Dumitrescu","I'll see it handled. With my own two hands if I have to",
				"Chromit","Let's go now. It is our obligation",
				"Narrator","They -and hundreds more- marched on to fight for the eastern bank of Kaula. At the same time the Civil Guard was deployed to go along with them",
				"Vanessa","Say, Emil, do you think Transkal could develop such respectable traditions?",
				"Gustav","Your Majesty, you weigh 50Kg wet and well dressed. Your presence on the battlefield would not be helpful, not to mention your death would be more debilitating to us than Chromit's would be for the whites",
				"Vanessa","I wonder"],
				
				//Spruce's Hook
				["Buvac","Coastal Patrol Airfleet 1,2,3,4 and 5 have been deployed according to your specification",
				"Spruce","And not a moment too soon nor too late. I am very much pleased, Commodorissimo.",
				"Buvac","Notify me of whether they coordinated well or anything else. I am awaiting curiously",
				"Kronegar","Did... did we just spawn an air armada of naval bombers right behind enemy lines?",
				"Spruce","We ran into the shallows of the archipelago so that we trigger their desperation into attacking furiously when they think we made a mistake out of overconfidence; then syncronize the carrier-borne planes and land-based ones to strike at the same time from two directions",
				"Orzel","That's kinda like Austerlitz or something like that, I think",
				"Spruce","I like how that sounds. Ursa shall be our Austerlitz",
				"Kronegar","So this is why they put you in charge. You have my respect, cowboy",
				"Spruce","Let's end this",],

					//Vladov Subplot
						//Fall of Vladov
						["Kuzmich","We're merely two hundred kilometers or so from Kaula. Would it be that difficult for them to send some more men here? How many troops does Kaula need anyways!?",
						"Vladov","Chromit and Dumitrescu no doubt want 500.000 in Mazowia, maybe 200.000 more",
						"Kuzmich","Well!? Hryniuk and Kovalchuk are likely in Mazowia already, and they could conscript 200.000 locals since it's a bloody big city!. They should've gotten those numbers by now so where are they?",
						"Kuzmich","Are they going to wait until the pincer is closed and we're trapped like Broz?",
						"Vladov","I'd love to simmer in my own irritation with them but for the sake of not losing our mind in these hard times, let's look on the bright side. The kargits only hold most of the west bank. The pincer has seven kilometers that they want in order to close the pocket, but that's where the reinforcements are coming to strenghten",
						"Kuzmich","The bright side, huh",
						"Vladov","So long as nothing unfortunate happens, we will prevail",
						"Narrator","[15 minutes later, an artillery shell hit the bunker Vladov and Kuzmich were planning in, triggering also an unexploded shell lying by, the resulting explosion cratering the roof of the bunker and incapcitating the two with falling debris]",
						"Narrator","[With them comatose, the subordinate generals fought to the best of their ability and were able to coordinate adequately. But adequate coordination is not enough in front of the kargits]"],
						//Radio Silence
						["Dumitrescu","Vladov! Vladov, did you shove that phone up your ass?",
						"Narrator","[radio silence]",
						"Narrator","By now, the kargits managed to take advantage of the situation and to trap much of Army Group 8 inside Patna"],

					//Deluge and Military Reforms
						//Fall of Iber + Proclaiming 'Time of Crusade'
						["Kovacs","We have the immense pain to announce that Iber, our western shield, has fallen to a horrible, unrelenting enemy assault. The martyrs held out against furious, unprecedented bombardment and enemy troops rumoured to fight like demons, cut off from supply by unbeforeseen airborne attacks behind the frontline.",
						"Kovacs","They fought admirably and to the last man, and continue to oppose enemy advance even now, but could not stop them. Even now, their hordes rampage through Anin and Stulpika, aiming to subjugate as many of us as they can. Wherever the enemy armies go, they leave behind atrocious deeds, things which cannot be described",
						"Kovacs","The kargits and their allies stand poised to destroy us, to erase our history, our culture, to desecrate our faith and barbarize each and every one of us. Our hand is forced to declare Times of Crusade, to unite once more in body, mind and spirit and shatter the satanic hosts in a total war for our very existence",
						"Kovacs","I thereby invest Ladislav Chromit as Primarch to steer us through these dark times. My wisdom, guidance and prayers will be with you althroughout"],

						//Fall of Vythm'k + Founding the Air Force
						["Dumitrescu","Explain to me HOW IN THE BLOODY FUCK are the kargits pushing US out of Vythm'k, when we have slight numeric superiority, airforce parity and I've been told our men fight with bravery!",
						"Vladov","They are indeed fighting with bravery but aside from the White Guards, they are only human. Kargits have this drug, Redrum or Red Sugar, that makes them fight with fanatic courage and superhuman strength. They fight like literal demons from Hell.",
						"Dumitrescu","The famous Redrum, no? Shimdarin told us that its withdrawal is horrifying, so those who take it are doomed to stay on it forever. And after at most two years, it begins to do more harm than good, I heard it begins to rot their brains and paralyze them. So we only have to weather the storm until the drug's effects turn against them",
						"Anders","And air parity we only have on paper. But all of us field marshals, marshals, generals, corporals, barely sleep 6 hours a day and we still cannot manage to command the airwings efficiently, sometimes we can't order them at all",
						"Anders","Simply put we have been assigned to command too many units at once",
						"Vladov","We desperately need a separate air command, it's just like Buvac said, we cannot be in two places at once",
						"Dumitrescu","I know what Buvac said, but you know how Paragon Dragalina is. Futu-l √Æn gurƒÉ de paranoic a»ôchilopat. If we create a third arm of the military, they're gonna think we're trying to establish a military dictatorship",
						"Dumitrescu","I know that's idiotic, but that's what the Paragon thinks. And maybe the Paradygmist would agree with him",
						"Anders","Who gives a shit!? The Paradygmist proclaimed it is a 'Time of Crusade' so what the Primarch says goes.",
						"Dumitrescu","No, I'll call the Paradygmist directly. This has to be done or we'll all perish with a fork up our asses",
						"Dumitrescu","Allo, your Excellency",
						"Kovacs","Rare that you call me directly. How may I help you, Generalissimo?",
						"Dumitrescu","The situation requires me to. We need to establish a third arm of the nonconsecrated military but that goes against the Holy Laws of Governance.",
						"Kovacs","Normally we cannot go around them, but there is a workaround. I surrendered command of the holy White Guards to you, Generalissimo, did I not?",
						"Dumitrescu","Yes, and it was a wise choice",
						"Kovacs","Append all air units to the White Guard, move all White Guards to army command and tell me who should I bless into command of the Air Forces",
						"Dumitrescu","Buvac seems the most fitting. He has been notoriously obsessed with airplanes for a long time. And since the army is commanded by a Generalissimo and the navy by an Admiralissimo, he should be the first Commodorissimo",
						"Kovacs","I shall speak to all who would need to hear it, and get this issue solved for you. We stand behind you and whatever you will need to drive the kargit devils out, we shall provide. May God bless you, Generalissimo",
						"Dumitrescu","I am ever so thankful to you for ridding me of this mess, Your Excellence. Now, there is another logistical and an organisational mess that yours truly has to deal with"],

						//Fall of Panere + Puric's Trial
						["Anders","My subordinate Kuzmich's forces are being driven southeast, and Kowalski is being driven east and northeast.",
						"Dumitrescu","I gave fallback order to the Mudakevo-Patna-Harpa-Konna line if this were to-",
						"Anders","You don't get it, Broz has not been driven back much. They were going around him and his hevan army group. He's almost encircled now",
						"Dumitrescu","OH FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!",
						"Dumitrescu","Order Broz to make a fighting retreat to the fallback line and have Kuzmich pin down the kargit units with a bitter counterblow",
						"Anders","Fantasy! Kuzmich is pinned down himself, he cannot possibly do anything. That's why I phone you",
						"Dumitrescu","For fuck's sake! Fine, I'll speak to Puric, he's under Vladov's theater but his area of operations is adjacent to Kuzmich.",
						"Dumitrescu","Allo, General Puric! What are your current orders?",
						"Puric","Marshal Martinovic has issued orders to pin Kulik's forces so that the stulpikan front can counterattack westwards",
						"Dumitrescu","Your troops aren't adequately issued artillery and armor, and there is insufficient air cover. A counterattack is asinine! By my order, move northeast and pin down Kulik's northern army",
						"Narrator","Two days later",
						"Anders","Dumitrescu, where is the fucking diversion? I thought you told Puric to pin down Kulik from the southwest.",
						"Dumitrescu","I did. I fucking ordered him!",
						"Anders","Then why is he moving west!? Broz is almost encircled and we can't fucking save him now, WHAT THE FUCK IS PURIC DOING!?",

Some of them suffer life-ending artery explosion; their arteries just explode and die in 5 minutes, some of them get one fatal bout of seizures and convulse to their deaths, some become insane and pluck out their own eyeballs and I could go on!",
				"Great Lord","What the absolute fuck!? How widespread is it?",
				"Khuzov","Depends on the sector. In some about 200 per day die like this, in others more like 500. We could lose half a million men merely from that fucking drug",
				"Great Lord","We need to-",
				"Khuzov","I'll spare you the trouble, the doctors already investigated what the problem is. The chemicals are already bad, but in our mass production we adulterated them with fucking fatal chemicals that make it worse. We need to slow down Redrum production and give them quality rations even if it's less. We have to do this or our entire army could collapse!",

				"Bela","You're grandstanding when the terrain you had to fight in was flatter than the one we fought in",

				"Hans","Isn't it obvious though? If I was encircled and they told me 'I will murder you, rape your family and piss in your skull' I would fight them to the bitter end with no fear or remorse. If they told me 'Give up and we'll send you to plant turnips till the end of the war' I'd be much more amenable",

				"Khuzov","It wasn't lost from the beginning. We had them from both sides and harried by the etrurians. It could've been won if Besarion and Ilych weren't retarded",
				"Kulik","And if Trosky's Banastoran Soviet wasn't also doubly retarded? Our soviet at least was centralized and there was SOME semblance of order",
				"Khuzov","Yeah... the cause had a few merits but if it produces leadership like that? No thanks",

				"Mutasarif","On the bright side once they get seasoned they'll be even better than the past Aghas. I have reason to believe a good few of the old ones are political appointees",
				"Esfahani","It is as you say. Faruk was a very wise Sultan, but he had to give certain lords prefferential treatment otherwise he wouldn't get anywhere. Political promotions in the military are bad from a purely military perspective, but the military is not often divorced from politics. Especially not in a state such as ours",

				["Hashrazzat","The kargits approved our request. They will send artillery that we badly need",
				"Mutasarif","Which kind? I specified that they should prefferentially deliver-",
				"Hashrazzat","Yes, we have agreed with them that they would rather deliver anti-air artillery than anti-tank. Because AA is also good against certain tanks and we only really need AT for those pesky Imperterrituses",
				"Mutasarif","Fair enough, that was the way we advised you to. How many did they relinquish?",
				"Hashrazzat","1500 AA and 500 AT. They will be delivered to Akkadia and Khorasan via shipping, then dragged by camel through the akkadian desert and then shipped by rail to Al'Khalif, and then to the front",
				"Mutasarif","Inshallah can't we finish the empire-wide railway so we can ship them from Samarqand to the frontline directly? There's only like 500Km left to plug between Shirvan and Khorasan",

				"Hashrazzat","Don't dismiss it so quickly. Think about it, it's cheap, fast and efficient, and that's what we need. We have no shortage of warriors who would earn their place in Jannah, we have less warriors than rifles if we're honest",

	Prologues:[
		["Great misfortune came upon the Federation. It's been a bad year because in short order, we've suffered from an absolutely MASSIVE corruption scandal(it didn't end without a few high-ranking people hanging from the noose), floods in the eastern sectors and a bad year for the economy overall.","Our neighbours have always wanted a piece of us.  And truth be told, we knew one day they'd stab us in the back, those scheming bastards. Unfortunately it had to be exactly now.","Reports of hostile troops massing to our borders came too shortly before the invasion began in earnest. We're yet to fully mobilize and the frontlines are in dissaray. Brave as they are, our men are frankly fighting against the odds. ","Make no mistake, this is not a petty war for a patch of land. The Kargits have already spouted their desire to exterminate our kin. We are fighting for our very existence and we'll be damned if they'll take even a single blade of grass without paying.","We WILL survive. We WILL overcome. And we WILL bring terrible vengeance upon them. ","No matter what the price."],
		["Three crowns for the kings of Vedra", "Seven more for the lords of Balfor.", "Nine for the counts of the heartland who are loyal to the Lord", "And the foremost crown, proudest of all. Goes to the Lord in the Marble Hall", "Him they must follow", "To him they must bow","His hand desires the globe","And to war he goes now.","Whomever tells you that a nation must have an army, has never heard of Kargi. Our entire nation is the army! Sure, we need people to farm and people to labour in the factories, but all the others are preparing for war.","The fuckers next to us are bigger and stronger, one would say. But we believe in Darwinist Stratocracy, and our destiny is to conquer the world.","We have waited far too long for an occasion, and here it is right in front of us. Our chance to destroy our biggest rival.","Unleash the Kargit warmachine! Let the tanks roll over their fields, and the bombs rain down on their huts!","We will show those animals who is the king of the jungle!"],
		["There we were, minding our own fucking business squabbling and trying to get something done, when lo and behold! Elamite troops are pouring over our and our Somertin friends borders.","As if that were not enough, cracked transmissions tell of a Polasion invasion of our northern regions, and that the Kargits also want our ass. Whether we want it or not, we find ourselves at war. Fantastic, since our military is a mess and various generals are fighting over who commands what.","Undaunted, the Queen will find a way to sort this mess and defend the nation.","With the invasion coming from two fronts at once, we'll aim to stabilize them and when possible, send some help to our allies. Because Elam and Polasie are powerful nations, but the Kargits moreso.","The silent taiga awakens."],
		["As the world's only free democracy, the Polasian leaders are accountable to the people. They have to justify their tenure via either victories, positive legislation or prosperity.","A century ago, thanks to the free market and democratic principles our nation saw an economic and cultural boom. New technology, better infrastructure and better living conditions. Eternal growth became demanded by the electorate.","But what will you do when eternal growth is no longer possible? Our resources are no longer sufficient and the common worker's wage has been nibbled at by inflation. Workforce and importing necessary resources are becoming too expensive.","Tensions are growing, exacerbated by the lower and lower standard of living. We tried dividing them up and passing all populist or liberal feel-good legislation, but that is merely a bandage on a gaping wound.","In order for democracy to survive, we need cheap workforce and cheap resources. And we know exactly where to get them from."],
		["Imagine for one second that you are the young Sultan of a great empire, whose father was a famed conqueror. To whom you look up to and aspire to match. His really untimely death caused a fucking ruckus and that, my friend, is your inheritance.","The Royal Court, as always, is a viper's nest with ambitious viziers and treacherous officials, all vying to manipulate or replace you, a 15-year-old kid.","The one way to justify your position is to do something, anything. Your industry is a joke, your economy is barely even agrarian, but you DO have an army of veterans from the Akkadian wars...and a giant neighbour who's about to get gang-banged by all other nations of the continent.","Saddle the warhorse, Sultan, for we have glory to earn!"],
		["The capital has been saved, but at a great price. Many men were lost and nowhere was it more tragic than in the city of Patna, where the Southwest Army under General Vladov were cut off. Despite their bravery, their hope dwindled away and one by one they threw down their arms, hoping to find peace and quiet from the fighting.","They could not have been more wrong. The PoW camps were nothing more than exploitation farms where they'd be forced to work until they drop dead. Those who could not, were lashed. Those who would not, were shot.","Their only alternative was to join the newly-formed 'Cohort Command', which will be sent to fight 'terrorists and other fifth collumnists', that is, their own people.","And thousands joined.","Rich as their ranks are, they lacked command, and no self-respecting Kargit would stoop so low as to command animals. The captured Vladov and his lieutenant Kuzmich have initially resisted the 'offer' of leading the force.","But after a few brutal beatings, torn nails and broken fingers, Vladov was broken as well. Kuzmich resisted a bit more, they had to use the 'Leather Boot' on him. ","Thus the Commandment of Somertin Cohorts is born, with its glorious duty to shoot at their own people."],
		["We are not the first to fight for freedom. No, there were several failed revolts before. I lost some good friends so far, that's why I know.", "But this time it will be different, because we see fewer and fewer guards every day. They're in dire need of men for the fronts. Those who replace them are more brutal, but cowardly. When we rise, they will run away like the little bitches they are.","What about you?","Our noble determination shall come face-to-face with the contemptible pragmatism of others.","You cannot remain neutral, you must come to take the side of the oppressed because you know that the beautiful, the sublime and the spirit of life itself are on the side of those who fight for light. For humanity. For justice."],
		["Surely, general Shmelev is loyal. Not to the Queen herself, but to the Matriarchy as an institution. As the structure which makes Transkal unique.","And if the Queen doesn't wish to preserve it properly, it is the duty of the old general. Perhaps the young dauphine will understand this better. Unfortunately, only Krystof joined this noble cause...and he's not easy to work with.","Oh well, you don't work with what you want, but with what you have.","The Matriarchal Mandate now belongs to Princess Isabella, and by the Gods she'll have a throne. And, in General Shmelev, a good advisor."],
		["The old capitalist order has brought poverty to the proletarian, and in the imperialist war of aggression tens of thousands of (gender non-specific noun) lost their lives. Nowadays there isn't even a hope of victory, for the fascists of Somertin are kicking our ass so bad that it's red. It's time for a revolution!",	"After the capitalists are punished, and the corporations that don't back us are liquidated, we'll sue for peace with those fascists and ensure our freedom, equality and socialist paradise.","March to the barricades, workers and minorities! It's time to fight for freedom!"],
		["A quick look at the situation tells us what? We've been pushed back over our own borders and armament is running low. The Polasians are kicked out of the continent, the Kargi are beyond the mountains. What the hell? It has 'defeat' written all over it.","It's all because of that snot-nosed kid who we have to call Sultan. If he wasn't such a fucking sperg, we wouldn't have been in this situation.","There is a glimmer of hope to this situation, however. The Polasians got away basically scot-free. So, if we turn coats we may yet be able to get a lenient deal at the end of the war.","And save our own ass."]
		],
	Epilogues:[
		"The White Army fought like lions, and to the last man. But their fate was sealed since the beginning: Try as they might; subhumans will never win against the superior race.",
		"The Kargits were right: The strong will always rule over the weak. Unfortunately for them they were judged by the war and found weak.",
		"The Transkalite Army was swept away by a tide of steel. Once more, a house divided was doomed to fall upon itself.",
		"The Polasie Republic has been toppled, and in the mess that ensued they are no longer able to be a factor in world politics.",
		"The Elamite Army has fought bitterly with what little they had, but it was not enough. They were small fish in a big ocean, and now they are claimed by the maws of great sharks.",
		"Having sustained huge losses, the Judas Legion has practically ceased to exist. Their great debt has been fully paid out. In blood.",
		"Though the men and women of the Front of Liberation fought with everything they had, it was not enough.",
		"The Junta's officers are hanging from the gallows. The Brown Army has been decapitated, and awaits the final verdict.",
		"The flame of the Revolution has been snuffed with spit and piss. And the bubble of this folly has been popped. Today they face reality.",
		"The Blue Army has been put down. The hope of even an autonomous Elam is gone down the drain."],
	EpilogueQuotes:[
		"Torture, mutilation, slavery, rape, plunder, robbery, genocide and all the other horrors of the world are noble if the strong decree as such. When the dust of the battle settles it is not the ones who are right that write history and law, but the ones who are left. For this weakness, the people of Somertin and many others shall suffer a thousand years of darkness. Their women shall forcefully bear the seed of the invaders, their symbols and culture shall be vigourously smashed, they shall deliberately be inflicted injustice upon, and they shall labour for those that are doing this to them. On their backs shall the master race achieve their utopia of equality and prosperity.",
		"So many times those who proclaim the law of the jungle turn out to not be the apex predator, but mere fools overtaken by a ruthless hubris and a desire to bring suffering for their own entertainment. For them there will be no forgiveness, the souls of our brothers and sisters cry out for vengeance!",
		"Today they shall weep three times. Once because their sons are forever gone; twice because the victor's justice will be imposed on the innocents; and thrice because their history, culture and legacy has been washed away. Today the taiga goes silent, this time forever.",
		"The torch of democracy, of rule by the people and for the people, is an utopia. People are stupid. It will take a decade, a century, or a millenium, but the torch will inevitably go out.",
		"Their skulls and bones were not bricks for your statues and monuments, Pharaon! The empire you striven so hard to build shall one day come crashing down, swept away by the rivers of blood you spilled. Sword be upon your neck!",
		"When ordered to fire at their own family, the soldiers shall break ranks; they will fight for you no longer.",
		"They died free. There is no better ending.",
		"What does one hope to achieve by defending a system so thoroughly rotten that a gust of wind could blow it away? It was a fool's rebellion, and they recieved a fool's reward.",
		"Disgruntled, they tore off all that belonged to the old regime; not knowing that the hope for a better life was, itself, a marketable lie. All of their culture and mentality was built on false assumptions; their little revolution simply tried to exchange a lie with another. Now that the bubble has been popped, they will see the world, as rotten and hopeless as it really is.",
		"And the tears and devastation, of a once-proud warrior nation, this I know for I was riding with them too"

				"Vladov","The central front is a mountain range, Dumitrescu. Mountains. This is a river whose bridgeheads we lost. We're understrength and outnumbered, Dumitrescu!",
				"Dumitrescu","Alright, alright, I get it.",
				"Vladov","We're fighting over plains, for fuck's sake! Tell them to move their ass! If you don't, they'll break through and fuck everyone's rear, Dumitrescu!",
				"Dumitrescu","I understand. Vladov, I'll send the first shares towards your section. You buy us some time and I've got your back. How's that?",

					"Anders","What are you talking about? The attack took most of them before we could even get there.",
					"Dumitrescu"," Oh crap! How many held?",
					"Anders","Two are in our hands, the other fifteen are lost.",
					"Dumitrescu","All is not lost. Hold them for as long as possible.", 
					"Anders","I'll do as much as I can, but there better be reinforcements available.",
					"Dumitrescu","Mobilization is taking place as we speak. You'll have the men you want, but you need to hold.",
					"Anders","What if Vladov's south collapses?",
					"Dumitrescu","Then you are to take command and strenghten the Mudakevo-Patna-Konna-Harpa line. But I doubt Vladov's forces will collapse; he's a competent commander.",

					"Stoyan","We're holding them off behind the Heva river. We have a bridgehead over Heva, however.",
					"Dumitrescu","Fantastic! How did you manage to hold them off so well?",
					"Stoyan","Simply because they're morons! They march without scouting, attack without probing, and they seldom secure their flanks.",

				[//Chapter 1, Mission 5
					"Chromit","Generalissimo, what is the operational status?",
					"Dumitrescu","Kargit pace of advance is slowing down; they are close to their Clausewitz Culmination. That, however, must not obscure the fact that the bulk of their forces has mustered ahead of Kaula",
					"Chromit","They will try to envelop it as they did with Patna?",
					"Dumitrescu","The river flanks are well defended this time, which explains why they rather seem poised to reach the citadel. They believe it'll be faster than storming fortified bridgeheads",
					"Chromit","Fools. They underestimate us, even now",
					"Dumitrescu","I hear fortification and preparation efforts are going well",
					"Chromit","We had expanded the Civil Guard with tons of refugees who are willing to work for bread; and with women and children who would otherwise have no utility",
					"Dumitrescu","Good; but I'll rather have you raise new units from them. We need filler for the frontlines and fast",
					"Chromit","You will have them. Any boy 14 or older is getting incorporated. We've raised ten entire divisions in such manner.",
					"Dumitrescu","One worry off my chest.",
					"Chromit","After the battle of Kaula is over, however, we WILL disband these ad-hoc banners. Snot-nosed children with rudimentary training lose efficiency very quickly",
					"Dumitrescu","So long as Kaula holds. Now, are we prepared against paradrops? Kargits seem to do them every time",
					"Chromit","Women, elders and boys 10-14 will be sent to the batteries. The paratroopers will be torn down, and those who DO manage to land will be hunted down and gutted.",

					"Chromit","Why, with the Honour Guard and the Transkalites",
					"Dumitrescu","They arrived? And we're also raising the honour guard?",

					"Vanessa","Primarch, Generalissimo, inform me what is the Honour Guard if you will.",
					"Dumitrescu","Ah, Your Majesty. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.",
					"Chromit","The Honour Guard is the sacred duty of the Somertin ruling class. In times of extraordinary duress, politicians will leave instructions to be carried out in their absence, and then they draft themselves into a temporary Guard battalion.",
					"Vanessa","You're joking with me",
					"Chromit","Not the case. It is a temporary measure and our instructions contain provisions for any contingency imaginable.",
					"Vanessa","Apologies if it came out the wrong way. I can understand that it can function in some manner; but politicians going to the frontline? That's a fairytale",
					"Chromit","It is our culture. Somertins do not have jobs, we have a duty and we do it with fanatic dedication.",
					"Vanessa","Transkal has a saying that 'there are as many customs as there are yurts'. I see now what that means. Have you, however, considered what would happen to Somertin shall the Honour Guard perish or incur severe casualties?",
					"Chromit","Yes. For such situation we have prepared contingency measures and discussed them with the Military High Command.",
					"Chromit","The sum of these measures is called Operation ARMAGEDDON",
					"Vanessa","I don't like the way it sounds. What does it involve?",
					"Chromit","It shall be revealed to you after the Battle of Kaula. For now I have said all that I needed to. Excuse me but I have to go prepare for the ordeal.",
					"Vanessa","You're...I see. Farewell and may your God be with you all.",
					"Dumitrescu","There are affairs that the Generalissimo of Somertin and the monarch of its ally must discuss. Your men have arrived in Kaula, have they not?",
					"Vanessa","Indeed, we are sending an entire army group in the citadel numbering two hundred thousand with heavy equipment",
					"Vanessa","And Bertha rail-artillery.",
					"Dumitrescu","Perhaps Chromit wants to fight house-for-house and drive them out of the capital but I find that foolish. With all the authority I command, I ask you to divert half or more of your men to the south outskirts of the city.",
					"Vanessa","I'll have to speak with the generals to do so",
					"Dumitrescu","And which one of them is the best for corps command?",
					"Vanessa","General Vilho",
					"Dumitrescu","I want him and your best men on this maneuver",
					"Vanessa","Normally you would be asking for a fantasy, since Transkalite generals do not command whichever troops they'd like but the men that follow them. Luckily for you Vilho's men are the best",
					"Dumitrescu","Very good. Together with Anders's men they will smash into the kargit flanks like a pincer. I'll set up my headquarters inside the citadel and hold the line until then",
					"Vanessa","You and the Primarch are holding up very well given how much is on the line.",
					"Dumitrescu","Is it surprising? Being alone against an unforgiving enemy, with destiny and everything on the line, where one mistake can cost a hundred thousand lives puts a lot of stress on one's nerves. But it also fills him with resolution; there is no duty more sacred than defeating the Kargits and saving the nation. I am sure you can understand",
					"Vanessa","I can't get rid of the feeling that I am blundering somewhere, though",
					"Dumitrescu","Only the right person wonders if they might not be suited. The fool is all too confident. Now, mobilize yourself. You need to convey my directives to your generals so that we may drive the kargit scum out of our holy motherland.",
					"Vanessa","Impolite way to speak to someone who technically outranks you. Is it the vaunted somertin arrogance I've been warned of by some advisors?",
					"Dumitrescu","Young girl, I do not care who you are and what pleasantries are customary in your land. I have a war to carry out, not politics. If you want honeyed words, talk to Chromit.",
					"Vanessa","Rude, but I like not being fed fritters.",

				"Dumitrescu","Allo Hryniuk, you are needed",
				"Hryniuk","Understood. How may I serve?",
				"Dumitrescu","Anders and the transkalite Vilho had led a pincer which saw a hundred thousand kargits encircled. However, they lack the force to liquidate them AND parry kargit attempts to break them out.",
				"Hryniuk","I understand that my duty will be to liquidate that pocket",
				"Dumitrescu","Precisely",
				"Hryniuk","That is an honor. I will gladly take up this ordeal",
				"Dumitrescu","The capital's rail network has been brought up to nominal status, as it should, so when the Kargits capitulate, we will ship them to the agricultural districts out east.",
				"Hryniuk","Stupid question, I know, but how are the camps administered?",
				"Dumitrescu","HEH. That is far from a stupid question. As far as the higher ups told me, they are set up in farmable areas of Burluk and the captives will recieve good rations AND be able to earn more by farming or working.",
				"Hryniuk","I find it wasteful that we give them such good conditions. They are scum and deserve nothing less than death.",
				"Dumitrescu","However the Paragons may argue, it's not a matter of kindness. It's cold pragmatism. If rumours that prisoner camps are horrible circulate, the enemies will be more inclined to fight to the death, thus making any advance slower and more costly.",
				"Hryniuk","They do not extend the same courtesy to us, you know? God forbid anyone end up in a kargit POW camp. Or worse, an Elamite one",
				"Dumitrescu","I figure the Kargits consider not killing prisoners on the spot kindness. Their pragmatism goes more towards the brutal type. As for the Elamites? I reckon their industrial base being horrendous as it is does not allow such expenses.",
				"Hryniuk","I am not referring to that. But it's best to avoid that subject for now",
				"Dumitrescu","So be it. Now, you understood your task, did you?",
				"Hryniuk","Affirmative",
				"Dumitrescu","Good. Next issue. Vladov's Central Front is in tatters after Kuzmich and Broz's armies have been decimated. From this moment onward you are promoted to Field Marshal and I'm expecting you to rebuild the central front from the ground up",
				"Hryniuk","I have several questions-",

				"Laszlo","Wait, was I sent here because High Command thinks me incompetent?",
				"Dumitrescu","Absolutely not. You were given the south because it's highly mobile; and you are known to be neurotic and aggressive. High Command believes that, given sufficient men and materiel, you can make swift work of the Elamites.",

				"Dragalina","A line of barbed wire, palisades and a concrete bunker every 2 kilometers.",

				"Narrator","When Polasie made footfall in Jarvi, the queen ordered the jarvian fleet(plus the ships that escaped from Svelge to jarvi) to relocate to the faraway port of Pori. From there, they sailed through the Kolguyev Pass(which was considered impossible for a warfleet) escorted by icebreakers, moored and refueled in Norgel, then sailed to Jylla.",
				"Gustav","The day before yesterday, indeed. But your majesty, this is a bold plan, shall we say a VERY risky one.",
				"Gustav","I am unused to sailing, shall we say I never had the chance to learn how to do naval warfare. And sailing two thousand kilometers without oilers... why don't we bring some from Somertin?",
				"Vanessa","They said it's too far way for them to sail securely, they don't fit through the Kolguyev Straits and cannot sail around the entirety of Kargia. And that the Polasian navy would complicate it further...and that Petro doesn't have any to spare. So we will overfuel our warships and send our own, improvised oilers with them, then abandon them on the way back and only sail the big ships home.",
				"Gustav","That distance is just not feasible for what we have, it just isn't. The distance between Odenshagen and Sekir Bashka is 2200Km and that is the closest harbour we can hit",
				"Vanessa","But what if we speak to Admiral Petro Melnyk to moor and supply in Cymelium Harbour first? Zaburluk is at least 1000Km closer to Elam than Odenshagen",
				"Gustav","In this situation, we can pull it off. But while we're at it, couldn't we ask for them to sortie with us? They had built three battlecruisers with the express purpose of matching the elamite battleships.",

				"Gustav","Excellent, then we can let those take the brunt of the battle and we aid them, screen when it is necessary",
				"Vanessa","Oh no way. We have the means to earn esteem in front of the somertins and we will do so. Our ships will charge ahead and fight the green battlefleet with dignity. It will be us who lead the battle, not the whites",
				"Gustav","Overfueled cruisers charging at battleships is ludicrous, we would go up in flames!",
				"Vanessa","The FCS's we bought from Somertin and retrofitted these cruisers with shall make a difference against the obsolete Elamite battlecruisers, we would far surpass their rate of fire. As for exploding... besides them not being so overfueled when we get there, look at it from my perspective",
				"Vaessa","They are a drag on the Royal Exchequer, ships cost a lot to maintain and aren't producing any money. Not to mention, they are so obsolete they don't measure up to any modern navy. One day we will replace them, but now let's use them for once dammit. They've burned money like gasoline",

We have crippled the Elamite navy so they can no longer lead amphibious operations, crippled the Polasian army so they have nothing to land, and butchered the Kargit SpecOps so they can no longer do airborne operations.

Next to them will be Transkal which cannot muster more than two hundred thousand light infantrymen without Somertin giving them gear. They will percieve our separate peace as betrayal and will be pissed.",

They'd have medical supplies, guards, heavy armor, air supremacy and the naval leverage to land troops anywhere in Transkal. Do you think we would advance more than one kilometer?",

					"Esfahani","Expansion is the problem, not the solution. We must find a way to consolidate what we'll gain. Given the Whites will be gone and the Blacks reignant, we must be really wary. Their arms industry dwarfs ours and the polasian one put together.",

					"Esfahani","There are other options. In a post-Somertin era, they can import cotton from the outside world. The Khedivate, Porte and even Eagleland offer it really cheap",
					"Mutasarif","A post-Somertin world assumes for us a diplomatic stance of solidarity with the Polasians. The Kargit imports will have to regard polasian naval supremacy, and the fate of the White Navy.",
					"Esfahani","Good, good. But then there's the issue of Polasie not taking losses well unlike the Blacks, and their naval industry being as stagnant as their military. And worse, the issue of Omck",
					"Esfahani","The Somertins are making guncotton without cotton; in heavily-wooded areas. This technology is ubiquitous, and the kargits could do it, but they'd rather hope to capture the Omck-North Burluk area.",

					"Mutasarif","You should know that advancing over mountains is not the same as advancing over rivers and fields as we have so far. We'd need more specialized equipment",
					"Esfahani","Jibril, we will do all that has to be done and get that area! No matter how many sacrifices have to be made, if we do not have the high material ground there is no other outcome for us but to end this exhausting war and be exposed to the Kargit boot!",

We are running pretty meaningful deficits. 20% deficit of armor, 20% of mechanized vehicles and common trucks, and we've had to bring old artillery and tank rifles. All we can give you is bolt-action rifles and mortars; but we both know our mortars-",
				"Esfahani","All you can spare is good. But make an effort to spare more. You want as many of their divisions away from the capital, right? We do not make much of a diversion if we fight with bows and muskets.",

We can probably make do with some second-rate mortars and grenade launchers if we jury-rig their uniform to withstand more recoil, but you have to give something. Either artillery or mortars. We have a critical lack of firepower and the rifles don't do much",

				"Esfahani","Our Kargit allies committed the reserves to the citadel of the capital region and got them encircled and destroyed. Then Somertin forced their temporary firepower advantage. Both them and the Kargits have bled eachother white for this state of affairs",

				"Ali","We have to maintain an offensive pace! The Kargits cannot regain initiative if the Somertins aren't harangued",
				"Esfahani","We need to discuss economics",
				"Ali","Oh no...",
				"Esfahani","It has become apparent to me that the Kargits were running on equipment amassed pre-war, which they now run deficits of across all chapters except maybe bolt-action rifles. The somertins, however, have started with deficit and are now at the same deficit, but not one bit lower",
				"Mutasarif","How!?",
				"Esfahani","I believe it is because being on the defensive side of a total war gives one greater outcome than on the offensive. On paper both kargit and somertin military plants function 3 shifts a day, but kargit ones are beginning to slack despite the draconian discipline wheras draconian discipline is still efficient in the Somertin ones. Put to that the fact we grossly underestimated white industry in the first place",
				"Mutasarif","Inshallah! How do they manage to both feed themselves AND staff the factories to the maximum?",
				"Hassan","They import grain and consumer goods from Eagleland and Albion. And since it's not armaments, the Polasians have no legal basis to torpedo these ships, nor do they have the muscle to piss off Albion and Eagleland while doing so",
				"Hassan","So, what are we going to do?",
				"Mutasarif","I suppose we'll keep our positions so they at least have to divert units here. And try to restore some order so we can use the captured industry for our sake",
				"Esfahani","We need the Sultan. Tell him to do some legal yadda yadda that gives somertins under occupations good conditions. Reopen the theaters, churches, etcetera and enforce discipline on the men. And hold a speech about equality between the Sultan's subjects",
				"Mutasarif","That sounds easier than it is to do",
				"Esfahani","For the sake of the war, we will make some sacrifices.",
				"Ali","I object. Conversion of the kaffir must begin at once so we finish their integration faster",
				"Mutasarif","That is... not doable. We've made ourselves plenty hated, and the guns are not flowing into our armories. We need those industrial facilities manned. As fast as possible",

				"Mutasarif","FIFTY-SEVEN!? We surrounded and destroyed that corpus before!",
				"Esfahani","Most of it, but they seem to have remade it",
				"Mutasarif","Why are you so calm Ibrahim!? They remade an entire corpus from the ground up!",
				"Esfahani","I am... not calm. Just exhausted. Haven't slept in 40 hours, had to manage things at the front personally.",
				"Mutasarif","I understand. The sultan and us pashas were going to discuss industrial mobilization but you can go take a nap. You deserve it",
				"Esfahani","No, no, count me in. I can sleep after this.",
				"Hassan","We need more military production centers. As fast as we can get them up",
				"Esfahani","Machinery for them takes the longest to produce. Blast furnaces and lattices are expensive and need laborious work.",
				"Hassan","Precisely why we need to use... alternative methods. ",
				"Mutasarif","What do you have in mind? Do keep in mind we are overspending and importing is out of the question",
				"Hassan","One of my engineers said he can use naval machinery and wharfs to improvise arms plants. I have absolutely no idea how, but I trust him. That man is a genius. What I want then is the approval to strip down all naval bases except for the one in the Holy City and turn them to arms plants.",
				"Mutasarif","Fantastic! We don't need any more of them anyways. I'll get the Sultan to approve that for you. Thank you for the idea, brother.",
				"Hassan","The least I could do. Since, you know, there is no chance of us building more capital warships anytime soon.",
				"Esfahani","Forgive me for the stupid question but Somertin and Transkal are allied, and Somertin has a terrifying navy. Won't they base it in some Norgellian port and strike at us?",
				"Hassan","Transkalite ports are rudimentary, their wharfs cannot manage ships above 10.000 tons. Anything Somertin could send here would be outclassed by our Yavuz Selim and Osman Evvel. And they need all of them in the north where the Kargit and Polasian navies combined have some sort of temporary parity with theirs",
				"Hassan","HOWEVER! The shipyards in Cymelium are trying to put to sea three battlecruisers that could cause us great headaches",
				"Esfahani","Why aren't we striking them while they're not operational?",
				"Hassan","Nobody ever made a shipyard in a place where enemy fleets can just come and destroy them on a whim. Except by the use of aircraft carriers, of course, but we	don't have such a thing.",
				"Hassan","As for Cymelium, it's in the Asok Gulf that's chock full of coastal artillery. If our fleet entered that gulf, it would be surrounded on almost all sides by 40cm cannons. The outcome of that wouldn't be pretty",
				"Mutasarif","Clearly any such idea flies out the window then. We can't do a port strike of our own",
				"Esfahani","On another note, I have become aware that there are 'craftsmen' in Ararat and Ortadolu. These men make rifles and bullets without industrial machinery",
				"Mutasarif","Come again?",
				"Esfahani","I am not joking, they use these clay furnaces and hammers to forge rifles by hand, and copper they melt in stone crucibles to pour in bullet molds. As their forefathers were doing before the Industrial Age",
				"Hassan","That sounds romantic, such devotion to the craft of their ancestors. We can set offices to find them and order as many as they can make",
				"Esfahani","Exactly. We can rely on them to cover a part of our rifle needs, and shift part of the actual rifle factories to anti-tank rifle production. Shallah have mercy, the Whites are sending more and more tanks and we need to be prepared.",
				"Mutasarif","I'll get this approved as well, it is a great idea.",
				"Ali","Are the factories running 24/24?",
				"Hassan","Obviously. On 2 12-hour shifts because there's not many of them; they're easy to staff. Specialists are lacking, but we put them on 14 hour shifts so they manage.",
				"Ali","What about the arms plants of the occupied regions? We can ask the Jizya to be paid in rifles instead of money for the factory workers",
				"Mutasarif","We are already doing that, Ali",
				"Ali","We are? Good, good",

				"Hassan","It sure does look that way. Captured one lieutenant; and he blabbed that Transkal has purchased a few FCS computators from Somertin. Though why would one install FCS on 20-years-old-obsolete-cruisers beats me.",
				"Esfahani","Please explain what an FCS is, we do not understand naval jargon.",
				"Hassan","Fire Control System. It's an electromechanical device that coordinates the aiming and reloading of a ship's rigging so that it fires faster and more accurately. All modern ships have FCS of some form or another.",
				"Esfahani","I understand. Do the Yavuz Selim and Osman Evvel have FCS?",
				"Hassan","Yes, I paid for them myself before the war. Had the two battlecruisers sail to Polasie and have it installed. Won't tell you how much it costed, but I absolutely wanted our navy to be modernized and retrofitted.",
