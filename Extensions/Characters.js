It was there that he saw the hospitals full of the tortured and maimed, the killing fields full of mutilated corpses, and something snapped in his young mind. Not something exceptional(hatred of Kargia was common for those that fought in Albinia) but Ladislav took it too far. He was arrested for his hooliganish protests against the withdrawal and sent to a monastery for rowdy youths. There they were visited by future Paradygmist Kovacs, who talked to them and convinced them to channel their fury instead of lashing out at the world",
"Chromit understood then that feelings don't have much impact on the world, but his conviction didn't falter. He worked hard to understand the world as it is, its levers and pulleys and ten years later he saw himself in the political stage. He spent the next decade forging a path ahead for Somertin that well addressed the Kargit menace and in one of the few unanimous elections in Somertin's history, all Estates invested in him the power of being the Primarch shortly before the war began",
"His tenure was almost entirely dedicated to seeing Somertin safely overcome the kargit-elamite-polasian aggression and in planting the seeds for a harmonious Astartian Continent-State. To this purpose he carried out his duties dilligently, he oversaw the massive expansion and later demobilization of the largest army in history, oversaw the complete mobilization of the economy and in the dark days when Kargia was pushing with impunity he inspired the people by going on the frontlines of East Kaula and gunning down SpecOps himself. He made himself the embodiment of what Somertin stands for, and saw it keeping course through its greatest, darkest chapter"],

For Chromit never bathed in his laurels and never pulled more esteem to himself, he never claimed that crucial battles were his merit(despite fighting directly in East Kaula) or that he was something exceptional. Instead, he was the white eminence who worked tirelessly every single day so that all would work right. On certain days he would be at his desk for twenty-four hours, coffee in hand and papers in sight. He kept ethnic and religious tensions mute, ensured the gargantuan supplies that a ten-million-army needed and met with the outside world to ensure nothing unexpected happened.

"Bluffing his way he obtained a state envoy to go and remedy the soil of Omck for later cultivation. It was a total fiasco. Among all those assigned to this project, he was the only one to fail so spectacularly. Even though he believed everything was going to go right for him(because of signs he misinterpreted), his crops failed",
"This final straw broke his bloated ego and in urgent need for employment he enlisted. Having ditched his former personality and developing a worship complex for the concept of 'how', he quickly rose up the ranks and earned a state scholarship to Bukale.",
"With that graduated, he was sent to skirmish with the now-defunct Kargit Empire over Vythm'k. Dumitrescu of then saw his unit overgo radical reforms and perform way better than his peers. And that's how he and his contemporaries(Haller, Vazov, Argeseanu and the like) got into the positions they now have.",
"The reason he was chosen Generalissimo instead of the others was his ideology. Vazov clung to cavalry and disdained armor, Haller clung to trench warfare much like Vladov and Argeseanu was too much of a 'throw men and tanks at the issue' kind of a commander. Dumitrescu on the other hand had no doctrinal bias, he now believed in winning with whatever weapon or tactic it took",

Generalissimo Dumitrescu is a man who doesn't get involved in politics any more than he is forced to, does not dabble in pointless polemics and does not value anything but order, efficiency and obtaining the right outcomes. It was due to this pragmatism that Somertin's messy logistics were sorted out, the chaotic army reorganized and the kargits thwarted. He always took the path of practical, real benefit such as his insistence to forego the flashy White Guards and Imperterritus tanks in favour of efficient artillery and aviation, and to preserve as many soldiers's lives when practically possible.

Not because he had done something outstanding, but because the old guard was beginning to see the importance of aircraft and he was the only one authoritative on the subject, they awarded him that rank exclusively upon the army air corps",
"Once lieutenant, he made himself a nuisance, buggering the old army and navy command to support his idea of an autonomous air force, as a combat arm distinct from the army and navy. He was snubbed by the former Paradygmist who wanted the Guards to keep being the third arm(at the time the Guard was separate from the Army), by Dumitrescu and Spruce who did not desire a complication in their own modus operandi and by Chromit who did not want to intercede upon issues that he felt were above him",
"The onset of the war saw Buvac's ideations vindicated. Within two months from the onset Dumitrescu saw the army air corps taking beating after beating from the Kargit air forces(autonomous and thus doctrinally better). Spruce too felt that he could not develop the naval air doctrine while also managing the navy in wartime. With both and Chromit pressing the matter, the ex-Paradygmist agreed to change the very constitution of Somertin. Initially Buvac was named head of the Guards, then the Guards were merged with all the air command, then the land part of the guards was merged with Dumitrescu's Army and the air part being all that remained warranted a de-facto name change as well.

This was in no way easy and on occasion it took a toll on his health, but it earned him the respect of the rank and file.",

With that one out of the way, he sought to employ himself as a history teacher. But since in those times there was no national registry of educators and no standardized exam for qualification, one had to go looking for employment based on hearsay. He took the train to Kaula, Patna, Zadupie, even as far as Brzeskya and still didn't find a spot(there were way more graduates than open spots).",
			"Worse still, that was happening during the Albinian war. Being without a job, he enlisted and went off to fight. There he performed spectacularly. So much so that once, he led a platoon of men to sneak around kargit positions and capture a company bloodlessly. Impressed by his talent and sensing his potential, Haller and Dumitrescu congratulated him and paid for him to be sent to officers academy",

			"Since Anders had a passion for history where oftentimes battles were decided swiftly by intimidation, correct tactics or better positioning, he had a feeling that the metastrategy has returned to the same spot given today's technology. Only that the cataphracts of today are the armored columns, the light cavalry are the close air support airplanes, etcetera. This put him at odds with Vladov, who notoriously insisted upon fortifications, static defense and counterattack. The result was a brief rivalry until Dumitrescu had the now-graduate Anders promoted to be Vladov's equal in rank. That forced Vladov to accept that times were beginning to change.",

It was deemed unacceptable to Dumitrescu's pragmatic mind that all of SHC be defensive turtles who would let operational initiative in the hands of the kargits forever. So he had Vladov as field marshal of the center front and put the more energetic Anders to the northwest.",
"This angered Argeseanu greatly and the two fought loudly about it. With Vladov's intervention Argeseanu acquiesced, if reluctantly. The bullshittery didn't end even after Vladov got carpeted away. Dumitrescu offered the second FM position to Argeseanu who this time refused as his stress-induced ulcers were getting worse and he felt that position would be too much, so it went to Hryniuk.",
